Brooks spun these characters and story out of a well-reserched foundation—maybe no surprise from Pulizer Prize winner just as she.

Of the three stories across three eras (Antebellum Kentucky, 1950s NYC, and 2019 Washington D.C.), the first was far and away the most interesting and enjoyable.

And you really get your head into horceracing (p.40):

> 'All men are equal on the turf or under it'—that's the saying. But the folk who own the horses, it’s much more, for them, than an exciting day out. Here’s the ground of it, as I see it: a racehorse is a mirror, and a man sees his own reflection there. He wants to think he’s from the best breeding. He wants to think himself brave. Can he win against all comers? And if not, does he have self-mastery to take a loss, stay cool in defeat, and try again undaunted? Those are the qualities of a great racehorse and a great gentleman. A gentleman likes to have a horse that gives the right answers to those questions, then he can believe that he will give the right answers too. To do my part, I have to give a man a likeness that shows not just how beautiful the horse looks, but how beautiful it feels to him.

But then some of the "modern" dialogue in the 2019 D.C. Theo/Jess drama is cheesy and cringy:

> The hours are crazy, but the lab's sick. Anything I want—mass spec, cryo-EM, Illumina sequencer—I just ask and boom, it's there. Bright shiny everything. But I literally step over people sleeping in the street to get into the place. The homelessness here is epic.

It won't make the Favourites list, but overall glad I picked it up.
