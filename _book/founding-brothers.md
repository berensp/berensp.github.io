Step into the lives of the American founders and emerge with a perspective you weren't afforded during the revolutionary war chapter of your history class.

Ellis brings the nuance and nonobvious insights out of a small number of pivotal stories and founders (e.g., the duel between Burr and Hamilton on the cliffs of Weehawken, the dinner among Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and Alexander Hamilton). For example:
- As mentioned in [my patriotic Fourth of July post](heavn-rescued-land.html), America was by no means a sure thing. We'd like to believe that this band of patriotic men were all marching in lockstep toward a singular vision of this new republic. Not so...(p.216):
	> As Adams remembered it, on the other hand, "all the great crticial questions about men and measures from 1774-1778" were desperately contested and highly problematic occasions, usually "decided by the vote of a single state, and that vote was often decided by a single individual." Nothing was clear, inevitable, or even comprehensible to the soldiers in the field at Saratoga or the statesmen in the cooridors at Philadelphia: "It was patched a piebald policy then, as it is now, ever was, and ever will be, world without end." The real drama of the American Revolution, which was perfectly in accord with Adams's memory as well as with the turbulent conditions of his own soul, was its inherent messiness. This meant recovering the exciting but terrifying sense that all the major players had at the time—namely, that they were making it up as they went along, improvising on the edge of catastrophe.
- It's amazing the extent to which the matter of slavery almost undid the young nation. I didn't appreciate that it was a central issue in the 1770s and 1780s. And here it gets mitigated through Gradual Abolition Act of 1780 and other resolutions that kick the can down the road and intend to create a "glide path" to full eradication of slavery. It's interesting because the decision does irreparable amounts of damage (obviously), but also potentially preserves the nation...although you can't test the counterfactual.
- Republicanism vs. Federalism. Washington was actually deeply concerned about the divided political climate—some things never change. This tension that endures today is probably ultimately a healthy one.

Some criticize Ellis as too academic, but I think his writing is marvelous and I appreciate how well researched he is.
