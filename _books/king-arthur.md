Loved it. M. and I took our time over some months; he keeping all the different knights and their stories straight in his head.

And surprisingly Catholic. The Holy Grail features prominently, and spiritual purity and Christian ideals are bigger themes than I realized. The ending (epilogue, I think) is also unexpected but very impressive for a Christian/Catholic.

I knew it had really sunk in when he started telling me his own story and at one point says "on the morrow".
