So thoroughly enjoyable—it should maybe be in the [Favourites category](/books#Favourites)—but I read it so long ago now that it's hard to remember all the details.

(h/t to [mcandrew_m](https://x.com/mcandrew_m) for turning me on to John Irving...[*Avenue of Mysteries*](/books/avenue-of-mysteries/) is comin' up on the reading list.
