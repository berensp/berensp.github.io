The other day I had the most profound experience.

There was I, loping down the [Historic Trail on Mount Sutro](/twin-peaks-mt-sutro/), and as I run past this particular point, the podcast episode that I had listened to on this very path some *seven days prior* begins *re-*playing in my brain. Almost verbatim — and mine is by no means an exceptional memory.

The phenomenon of tagging memories to physical surroundings is known as *context-dependent memory,* and the idea is that our brains create associations between the context in which we learn or experience something and the information itself, such that recalling the context can help us retrieve the associated memories. The physiological mechanism underlying this phenomenon is thought to involve the hippocampus, a region of the brain that plays a key role in memory formation and retrieval.

Apparently, the hippocampus creates a kind of "neural map" of the environment, which helps to organize and store memories based on their location. When we subsequently try to recall a memory, the brain can use contextual cues, such as the sights, sounds, and smells of the environment, to activate the relevant neural network in the hippocampus and retrieve the memory. The [method of loci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/method_of_loci) exploits this faculty where "memory athletes," for example, will construct a "memory palace" that allows them to recall an insane number of digits of pi.

But for me it was nothing so deliberate; just a beautiful, eucalyptus-scented, birdsong-adorned urban trail through the woods that my brain put to good work as a mneumonic device.

And so I was plumb amazed both by how powerful the encoding can be (my near word-for-word recollection) and it seemingly being this background, unconscious process — unless interest or attention level is a factor (or a catalyst in the reaction).

Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, et al. were on to something with walking meetings *(solvitur ambulando)*: breathe some fresh air, boost your energy level, and maybe best of all, stimulate brain function. There's a body of research that suggests that moderately-intense aerobic exercise increases the size of hippocampus and improves memory (or at least staves off hippocampal volume loss and memory deterioration)[^1], so I'm thinking: pick up the pace and amplify the effects: ergo, *solvitur correndo.*
