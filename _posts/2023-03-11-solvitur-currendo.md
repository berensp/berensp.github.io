The other day I had the most profound experience. There was I, loping down the [Historic Trail on Mount Sutro](/twin-peaks-mt-sutro/), and as I run past this particular point, the podcast episode that I had listened to on this very path some seven days prior begins *re-*playing in my brain. Almost verbatimâ€”and mine is not an exceptional memory by any means.

The phenomenon of tagging memories to physical surroundings is known as *context-dependent memory,* and the idea is that our brains create associations between the context in which we learn or experience something and the information itself, such that recalling the context can help us retrieve the associated memories. The physiological mechanism underlying this phenomenon is thought to involve the hippocampus, a region of the brain that plays a key role in memory formation and retrieval.

Apparently, the hippocampus creates a kind of "neural map" of the environment, which helps to organize and store memories based on their location. When we subsequently try to recall a memory, the brain can use contextual cues, such as the sights, sounds, and smells of the environment, to activate the relevant neural network in the hippocampus and retrieve the memory. The [method of loci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/method_of_loci) exploits this faculty where "memory athletes," for example, will construct a "memory palace" that allows them to recall an insane number of digits of pi.

But for me it was nothing so conscious or deliberate; just a beautiful, eucalyptus-scented, birdsong-adorned urban trail through the woods that my brain put to good work as a mneumonic device.

So now I'm thinking Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg were on to something with walking meetings *(solvitur ambulando)*, but then there's evidence that ["exercise training increases size of hippocampus and improves memory"](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1015950108), ergo, a fortiori, *solvitur correndo.*

Just amazed at how powerful the encoding can be.
