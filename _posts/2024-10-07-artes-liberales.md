When I'd tell people I was majoring in Philosophy it wasn't uncommon for me to get a reflexive "Oh, what are you going to do with that?"

*I dunno...probably philosophy consulting?*

Truth is I didn't really have plans post graduation—although I did quickly figure out I wasn't interested in pursuing graduate studies in Philosophy with all those weirdos—I was merely captivated by the prospect of reading the great tomes of western civilization with these nerdy professors in tweed jackets *(ars artis gratia)*.

Since the mid-20th century with the GI Bill, the university degree has been democratized, and for most students and their families the degree has represented an earnings premium; and *a fortiori* today, manifest in the sharp increase in STEM and the corresponding decline in the liberal arts[^1].

[^1]: National Center for Education Statistics: from 2012 to 2020, graduates in the humanities declined by 30%. ["The Decline of Liberal Arts and Humanities"](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-decline-of-liberal-arts-and-humanities-western-philosophy-college-students-major-degrees-progressive-conservative-odysseus-6f327963), *Wall Street Journal*; March 28, 2023.

You can hardly blame the average american student/family for thinking about return on investment, when tuition has been outpacing wages for years on the cost side, and certain non-humanities degrees align with lucrative careers on the revenue side.

But ancient societies (e.g., classical Greece) placed great emphasis on cultivating virtue and excellence *(arete)* as the path to a fulfilling life. Aristotle, for example, argued that the highest good was *eudaimonia,* a life of cultivating virtue (wisdom, courage, justice, temperance, etc.) that leads ultimately to happiness.

Contrast that to modern societies like that of the U.S. which prioritize safety and economic prosperity as the two paramount metrics of social success—good things in themselves to be sure—because anything beyond these are entirely subjective. This relegating of government to safety and prosperity is an Enlightenment "achievement" (i.e. not a new thing), but the difference is that in the 18th century, the assumption was that religion would fill in the gaps (regarding virtue). For example, "pursuit of happiness" didn't need to be spelled out in "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" since God-fearing people had their Christian faith to inform them about *what* is happiness—if not eudaimonia—and *how* might we pursue it. But now that religion has been seriously attenuated in the West, the void produces a voluntaristic collision of wills, which leads straight to violence/war (Nietzsche spelled this out a long time ago).

And so, I think of the words carved into the Boylston Street side of the Boston Public Library in Copley Square, which I often walked past:

> THE COMMONWEALTH REQUIRES THE EDUCATION OF THE PEOPLE AS THE SAFEGUARD OF ORDER AND LIBERTY

Jefferson had a similar sentiment in one of his letters to Madison in 1787:

> Above all things I hope the **education** of the common people **will be attended to**; convinced that on their good sense we may rely with the most security **for the preservation of a due degree of liberty**.

And a third (from William Dean Howell) so that we can be sure that this theme isn't a fluke:

> All civilization comes through literature now, especially in our country. A Greek got his civilization by talking and looking, and in some measure a Parisian may still do it. But we, who live remote from history and monuments, we must read or we must barbarise.

But beyond being a good citizen what good is the liberal arts education?

## In favor of the Liberal Arts Education

- **Foundation for critical thinking and creativity.** That sounds like something out of a brochure you might find in an admissions office, but I think it's true and will be increasingly as AI is able to take more and more of the rote stuff off our plates. Including things that currently command a premium like certain corporate lawyering tasks, for example.

- **First principles thinking.** Having some frameworks and mental models to draw upon for decision-making on complex issues, which cut across history, philosophy, and other disciplines, is gold. Example: voting in California which consists of picking yes or no across a dozen propositions, a terrible responsibility when you can't possibly be adequately informed on each issue. You might look to this endorsement or that voter guide, but strip those away: how do you evaluate said proposition on its own merits? Other political debates may end in "because the Constitution protects it!" but can we go beyond the Constitution or the testimony of a certain respected forefather and defend idea from a first principles standpoint. This is becoming increasingly dififcult as we encounter and confront a fair amount of misinformation in the media landscape. Joyce Carol Oates said it well back in '06:

	> At a time when politics deals in distortions and half truths, truth is to be found in the liberal arts. There's something afoot in this country and you are very much a part of it.


- ***emollit mores nec sinit esse feros*** (i.e., *a faithful study of the liberal arts humanizes character and permits it not to be cruel*). This should link to a future post about cancel culture and how we perceive good and evil, but essentially, the more learned people are, the more understanding.

- **Specialization is for insects.** While certain specialties may command a wage premium, 1) they can go out of fashion as easily as they came in and 2) humans are too interesting and dynamic and talented to specialize at age 20. I love this one from Robert Heinlein:

	> A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.

- **Expertise?** A bachelor degree making you an expert in...nothing. Which is a good thing. That you have the space to become a broadly educated person is a good thing. Subsequently life will present you ample opportunities to build domains of expertise.

## But should everyone be a liberal arts major?

If possible, yes. There's a short amount of time to read the great texts and study the great thinkers and become learned, so that you can begin to whittle things down to that which is truly valuable and that which is not; and begin to build mental models and frameworks to become a thinking person. Michael Oakeshott puts it well regarding college:

> Here is a break in the tyrannical course of irreparable events; a period in which to look round upon the world and upon oneself without the sense of an enemy at one’s back or the insistent pressure to make up one’s mind; a moment in which to taste the mystery without the necessity of at once seeking a solution.

There's a fun debate on the liberal arts on the Moment of Zen podcast and one of the memes was, "you can literally just read [the classics]" on your own time. I mean, sort of... With a good study guide you can slog your way through the *Divine Comedy* and other similarly dense texts, but how much richer to do it with an excellent professor and a lively class discussion? Because you can flip this flippant statement to: "why would you spend your college years learning CS when you can do that on your own time with some videos?"

I'm something of a *Dead Poet's Society* romantic: I love the scholastic environment, the world of ideas, and I selfishly couldn't've imagined mortgaging my undergrad years for an accounting degree. At least at my alma mater, where there was so much on offer, to relegate the undergrad experience to vocational training strikes me as very sad. But nothing against accounting: the world needs excellent accountants; it's just not my particular calling. But the point here is how to think about true erudition versus job training, and how—and perhaps when—to accomplish each. Can future accountants spend time seriously immersed in the liberal arts before focusing on debits and credits, or should we leave that for others?

Manly P. Hall puts it more bluntly:

> The average person who goes to school has no idea why humanity exists. He has no idea concerning a spiritual factor in material existence. He has no general comprehension of the rules of life as these differ from the rules of social and political structures. He does not know where he came from. He does not know why he is here. And he has no idea where he's going. And on this compound ignorance, we offer degrees and make brilliant scholars of the people who have never answered any of those questions. It is one of these amazing things that we have created a great hierarchy of well-lettered ignorance. We have made everything subservient not to wisdom, but to the passing advantages of the hour.

It's not exactly fair, but if you study history at Biola University and aren't valedictorian, you may be kind of screwed. That's a supercilious and facetious way to put it, but also true: you can get away with studying Renaissance Literature at Yale because you were certified (on your college acceptance letter) as having the intellectual horsepower to do all kinds of things in the future.

Also not fair, but if you or your family has the cash, there's an art history degree available for you from a private college; but there's a separate question about public universities and whether taxpayers need to subsidize said degrees and/or their financing.

But does it have to be all or nothing? A thoughtfully constructed, integrated liberal arts core curriculum (the *Ratio Studiorum,* if you will), may not be such a bad runner-up to a liberal arts degree.

## Teleologically speaking

We've been talking about the university, but it's important to go back to the primary grades, and think about our educational models. Chelsea Niemiec from the University of Dallas summarizes the issue[^2]:

[^2]: Ibid.

> In the late 19th century, a series of progressive thinkers...set our country up to abandon a tried-and-true way of educating students in wisdom and virtue through the liberal arts and adopt a factory model meant to produce workers. The result? Plummeting reading and math scores and soaring anxiety and depression among students.

And so we have our son enrolled at a Catholic Classical school. Which is compelling from the standpoint of focusing on the liberal arts and their integration. But additionally, for us, everything connects back to Jesus Christ for *Gloria enim Dei vivens homo* ("The glory of God is man fully alive"), and we are alive insofar as we grow intellectually, morally, and spiritually through the pursuit of truth, beauty, and goodness.
