When I'd tell people I was majoring in Philosophy it wasn't uncommon for me to get a reflexive "oh, what are you going to do with that?" Of course, I never had the scarcest intention to pursue graduate studies in Philosophy; it was merely an interest and I was seeking to become a well-rounded critical thinker.

Since the mid-20th century with the GI Bill, the university has been democratized, and the degree has represented an earnings premium for most students and their families; and *a fortiori* today with the high demand for STEM and various liberal arts majors being shuttered.

But ancient societies (e.g., classical Greece and Rome) placed great emphasis on cultivating virtue and excellence *(arete)* as the path to a fulfilling life. Aristotle, for example, argued that the highest good was *eudaimonia,* a life of cultivating virtue (wisdom, courage, justice, temperance, etc.) that leads ultimately to happiness. Contrast that to modern societies like that of the U.S. which prioritize safety and economic prosperity as the two paramount metrics of social success—good things in themselves to be sure—because anything beyond these are entirely subjective. This relegating of government to safety and prosperity is an Enlightenment "achievement" (i.e. not a new thing), but the difference is that in the 18th century, the assumption was that religion would fill in the gaps (regarding virtue). For example, "pursuit of happiness" didn't need to be spelled out in "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" since God-fearing people had their Christian faith to inform them about *what* is happiness—if not eudaimonia—and *how* might we pursue it. But now that religion has been seriously attenuated in the West, the void produces a voluntaristic collision of wills, which leads straight to violence/war (Nietzsche spelled this out a long time ago).

And so I think of the words carved into the Boylston Street side of the Boston Public Library in Copley Square, which I often walked past:

> THE COMMONWEALTH REQUIRES THE EDUCATION OF THE PEOPLE AS THE SAFEGUARD OF ORDER AND LIBERTY

Jefferson had a similar sentiment in one of his letters to Madison in 1787:

> Above all things I hope the **education** of the common people **will be attended to**; convinced that on their good sense we may rely with the most security **for the preservation of a due degree of liberty**.

And a third (from William Dean Howell) so that we can be sure that this theme isn't a fluke:

> All civilization comes through literature now, especially in our country. A Greek got his civilization by talking and looking, and in some measure a Parisian may still do it. But we, who live remote from history and monuments, we must read or we must barbarise.

But beyond being a good citizen what good is the liberal arts education?

## In favor of the Liberal Arts Education

- **Foundation for critical thinking and creativity.** That sounds like something out of a brochure you might find in an admissions office, but I think it's true and will be increasingly as AI is able to take more and more of the rote stuff off our plates. Including things that currently command a premium like certain corporate lawyering tasks, for example.

- **First principles thinking.** Having some frameworks and mental models to draw upon for decision-making on complex issues, which cut across history, philosophy, and other disciplines, is gold. Example: voting in California. People who live in California know that we have this terrible direct democracy where, on election day, voters are not only picking their delegates and representatives, but also giving a thumbs-up or thumbs-down on a variety on a dozen propositions. Of course in most states this tremendous responsibilitiy is the jurisdiction of the representatives (what a concept), but even when the decision is given directly to the voter, it usually still gets outsourced; just to the org that produces the voter guide that seems the most reasonable. It's hard to have your frameworks in place to make excellent decisions on a variety of topics.

- ***emollit mores nec sinit esse feros*** (i.e., *a faithful study of the liberal arts humanizes character and permits it not to be cruel*). This should link to a future post about cancel culture and how we perceive good and evil, but essentially, the more learned people are, the more understanding.

- **Specialization is for ants.** While certain specialties may command a wage premium, 1) they can go out of fashion as easily as they came in and 2) humans are too intereting and dynamic and talented to specialize at age 20. I love this one from Robert Heinlein:

	> A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.

- A bachelor degree making you an expert in...nothing. Which is a good thing. That you have the space to become educated, broadly speaking, and then can focus in on interests after the fact.

## But should everyone be a liberal arts major?

If possible, yes. There's a short amount of time to read the great texts and study the great thinkers and become learned, so that you can begin to whittle things down to that which is truly valuable and that which is not; and begin to build mental models and frameworks to become a thinking person. Michael Oakeshott puts it well regarding college:

> Here is a break in the tyrannical course of irreparable events; a period in which to look round upon the world and upon oneself without the sense of an enemy at one’s back or the insistent pressure to make up one’s mind; a moment in which to taste the mystery without the necessity of at once seeking a solution.

There's a fun debate on the liberal arts on the Moment of Zen podcast and one of the memes was, "you can literally just read [the classics]" on your own time. I mean, sort of... With a good study guide you slog your way through the *Divine Comedy* and other similarly dense texts, but how much richer to do it with an excellent professor and a lively discussion? Because you can flip this flippant statement to: "why would you spend your college years learning CS when you can do that on your own time with some videos?"

I'm a *Dead Poet's Society* romantic: I love the scholastic environment, the world of ideas, and I selfishly couldn't've imagined mortgaging my undergrad years for an accounting particular calling. At least at my alma mater where there was so much on offer; to relegate the undergrad experience to vocational training strikes me as very sad. But we need excellent accountants, it's just a question of when and how we accomplish this. Can future accountants spend time seriously immersed in the liberal arts before focusing on debits and credits, or should we leave that for others?

Manly P. Hall puts it more bluntly:

> The average person who goes to school has no idea why humanity exists. He has no idea concerning a spiritual factor in material existence. He has no general comprehension of the rules of life as these differ from the rules of social and political structures. He does not know where he came from. He does not know why he is here. And he has no idea where he's going. And on this compound ignorance, we offer degrees and make brilliant scholars of the people who have never answered any of those questions. It is one of these amazing things that we have created a great hierarchy of well-lettered ignorance. We have made everything subservient not to wisdom, but to the passing advantages of the hour.

It's not exactly fair, but if you study history at Biola University and aren't valedictorian, you may be kind of screwed. That's a supercilious and facetious way to put it, but also true: you can get away with studying Renaissance Literature at Yale because you were certified (on your college acceptance letter) as having the intellectual horsepower to do all kinds of things in the future.

Also not fair, but if you or your family has the cash, there's an art history degree available for you from a private college; but there's a separate question about public universities and whether taxpayers need to subsidize said degrees and/or their financing.

But does it have to be all or nothing? A thoughtfully-constructed, integrated liberal arts core curriculum (the *Ratio Studiorum,* if you will), may not be such a bad runner-up to a liberal arts degree.

## What's the telos?

We have our son enrolled at a Catholic Classical school. Ultimately, for us, everything connects back to Jesus Christ for *Gloria enim Dei vivens homo* ("The glory of God is man fully alive"), and we are alive insofar as we grow intellectually, morally, and spiritually through the pursuit of truth, beauty, and goodness.
