And here I thought I'd fire out of the starting gate, confidently proclaiming a bold and singular angle for this forum...and...I don't particualrly have one. Ergo while it percolates I'll reserve the right to post boring topics as a means to record things as a diary of sorts for myself and my progeny. A censor-free, character-unlimited Twitter.

...so...

## Happy [#WorldBookDay](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WorldBookDay)

...from this slow reader guilty of [Tsundoku](https://www.google.com/search?q=Tsundoku) (Japanese: 積ん読). suggest we quantify our Tsundoku with a ratio—perhaps the Berens Ratio:

> total unread books on your shelf divided by average number of books read per year

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This week&#39;s cover, “Bedtime Stories,” by Bruce Eric Kaplan. <a href="https://t.co/KXNilCUARs">https://t.co/KXNilCUARs</a> <a href="https://t.co/S36UHATjzO">pic.twitter.com/S36UHATjzO</a></p>&mdash; The New Yorker (@NewYorker) <a href="https://twitter.com/NewYorker/status/1135516514910711809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

If it's more than than 100 minus your current age you need to start donating to your library...or build your own little free library. (This aligns with Tim Urban's point that you don't read an endless # of books in your lifetime. You read:

> expected age at death (90?) – current age * average number of books read per year

Tim has a [good insight/method for reading a lot more](https://twitter.com/waitbutwhy/status/1254121208053972992).

Compile my reading list in the style of 
https://markmanson.net/best-books/book-recommendations

That just means I need to prioritize my list. Here goes.

There are digital analogues to this, too: e.g. accumlating podcast episode at a rate that far outstrips your consumption. The feature of allowing a set number of episodes per podcast is just one of the many reasons I love [Pocket Casts](https://www.pocketcasts.com/) (encomium forthcoming...stay tuned).
