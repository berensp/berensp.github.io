And here I thought I'd explode out of the starting gate, confidently proclaiming a bold and singular angle for this forum...and...I don't particualrly have one yet.

Ergo, while it percolates I'll reserve the right to post a sm√∂rg√•sbord of topics as a diary of sorts for myself and my progeny: a future-proof, censor-free, character-unrestricted Twitter.

...so why not begin by wishing you...

## Happy [#WorldBookDay](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WorldBookDay) üìö

...from this rather slow reader guilty of [Tsundoku](https://www.google.com/search?q=Tsundoku) (Japanese: Á©ç„ÇìË™≠).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This week&#39;s cover, ‚ÄúBedtime Stories,‚Äù by Bruce Eric Kaplan. <a href="https://t.co/KXNilCUARs">https://t.co/KXNilCUARs</a> <a href="https://t.co/S36UHATjzO">pic.twitter.com/S36UHATjzO</a></p>&mdash; The New Yorker (@NewYorker) <a href="https://twitter.com/NewYorker/status/1135516514910711809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2019</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Tsundoku is much more meaningful when quantified with the **Berens Tsundoku Ratio**:

> `(current # of books sitting unread on the shelf + estimated acquisitions over the remainder of your life) √∑ avg. # of books you read per annum √∑ approximate # of years you have left on this earth (or can no longer read)`

`If (result) > 1 {` you can maybe do some donating and/or [build your own little free library](https://littlefreelibrary.org)[^1], and if > 3 or so you might get evaluated for bibliomania.

[^1]: H/T to Tim Urban who pointed all of this out: that [there's a finite‚Äîand estimable‚Äînumber of things you'll do in your lifetime (including books read)](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html)...a sad reality but [there are things to do about it](https://twitter.com/maxjoseph/status/1121086199983157250).

Even if you're an e-reader‚ÄîI'm too bibliosmic to abandon hardcovers‚Äîit still behooves you to be *intentional* (to use the modern parlance) about what you consume since it's not only shelf space that is in limited supply but more than anything time. I'll try to keep a log [here](/books).

It's funny there are lots of analogues to Tsundoku when you start thinking about it; digital ones, too: e.g. accumlating podcast episodes at a rate that outstrips your consumption. The feature of limiting the number of downloaded episodes per podcast is just one of the many reasons to love [Pocket Casts](https://www.pocketcasts.com/)‚Äîstay tuned for forthcoming Pocket Casts encomium.
