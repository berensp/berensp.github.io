description: Please, don't be "into" wine.
---
Yesterday our family took our very first Pepsi Challenge. Blind taste test, no labels. And, sorry to brag here, but I confidently and successfully identified the Pepsi-Cola in all of its superiority to Coca-Cola.

But wine? That's a different story. I couldn't identify a "note" of anything...but you likely can't either.

In fact, it was our cola blind taste test that reminded me of these wine taste tests I read about a number of years ago in a viral article entitled *Wine Tasting Is Bullshit*[^1]:*
1. Statistician Robert Hodgson presented blindfolded experts with identical wines three times—their ratings varied by ±4 points on a 100-point scale. Only 1 in 10 judges rated consistently, and those who seemed "consistent" one year performed randomly the next.
2. Researcher Frédéric Brochet gave 54 experts two wines—one "red," one white. Both were identical whites; the "red" was actually a white dyed with food coloring. Every expert described the fake red with typical red wine language "jammy," "crushed red fruit"). Not one noticed.
3. When experts tasted identical Bordeaux from expensive vs. cheap bottles, they gave opposite descriptions—the "expensive" bottle was "complex" and "balanced" while the identical wine in the cheap bottle was "weak" and "flat."
4. A survey of 6,000+ blind tastings found that while wine experts enjoy pricier bottles more, amateur drinkers showed a *negative* correlation between price and enjoyment.

And so I'm generally suspicious of people who are (or claim to be) really into wine. Not because I have anything against wine itself—but because for many, it's a red flag for douchebaggery. I recognize some people are sincere and earnest wine lovers, but I'd wager that with a larger segment it's an affectation, signaling sophistication[^2].

[^2]:Very high-end restaurants is sort of like this for me, too. I probably burned the roof of my mouth on scalding hot cheese pizza a few too many times to have sophisticated taste, but I'm skeptical.

Over a decade ago was a winery in the Dogpatch neighborhood of San Francisco called Sutton Cellars where proprietor and winemaker Carl Sutton produced bottles of his own "natural" (unfiltered, no yeast) wines. He'd buy grapes from Mendocino and Russian River and I can't remember where else, and be very experimental—he loved Carignane and wasn't shy about Grenache, for example—and was all about vermouth. So the guy was serious and passionate about winemaking, but the best part about him and his winery was the unserious way he presented the wine and the experience at his winery on that corner of 22nd & Illinois. He made his tasting room welcoming, relaxed, no ego; and the approach to wine was all about "What do you like to drink? Come check this out." and none of "you should be detecting notes of blackcurrant, cedar, tobacco, and leather with hints of petrichor and crushed beetles" pretension you might find just 45 miles up the road.

Before that we had at Michigan the Wolverine Wine Club which had all the best intentions of introducing the uncouth MBAs to some refinement through good wine. But each event, despite it taking place at a lovely art gallery or another equally elegant venue, would devolve into debauchery. This so incensed the faculty liaison, who was a world-renowned sommelier, that he quit indignantly. We look back on the WWC and laugh, but then, I think, that fun and enjoyment is the real meaning of *oenophilia:* the enjoyment of wine; not feigning the ability to detect notes of wet limestone and saddle soap.

There is an inflection point, though, because it's true that the "Two Buck Chuck" is swill, and you know it and feel it. But as you go up the price curve, those interesting aforementioned research insights kick in and there are clearly (heavily) diminishing returns. A college girlfriend's father once shared his wisdom: pick a price range that works for your wallet, and figure out what suits you (which varietals, which regions, which brands). I guess you do that with any purchase: get to know and optimize within a price band. Ergo, the Trader Joe's boxed Chardonnay in our fridge! Seriously, Man! And then, truth be told, when we do have a "nicer" bottle of something—or a varietal we don't often drink—I find myself remarking what an enjoyable quaff it is.

So let the connoisseurs do their thing whilst you find your Sutton Cellars or secretly enjoy your delicious boxed wine. The science suggests you're not missing anything—except maybe some pretentious bullshit.
