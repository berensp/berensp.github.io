description: First post...finally. Might as well make it about books.

And here I thought I'd explode out of the starting gate, boldly proclaiming a singular angle for this forum...and...I don't particualrly have one yet.

So while it percolates I'll reserve the right to post a smÃ¶rgÃ¥sbord of topics as a diary of sorts for myself and my progeny: a future-proof, censor-free, character-unrestricted Twitter.

...so why not begin by wishing you...

## Happy <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WorldBookDay" target="_blank">#WorldBookDay</a>) ðŸ“š

...from this rather slow reader guilty of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Tsundoku" target="_blank">Tsundoku</a>.

How much more meaningful Tsundoku is when quantified with my **To Prune Or Not To Prune Ratio**â„¢:

> `(current # of books sitting unread on the shelf + estimated acquisitions over the remainder of life) Ã· avg. # of books read per annum Ã· approximate # of years left on this earth (or 'til reading no longer possible)`

If the result[^1] is approaching or greater than one I might consider:
* **Lending to family and friends**. Discover USPS' hidden gem formerly known as Book Rate and now called <a href="https://faq.usps.com/s/article/What-is-Media-Mail-Book-Rate" target="_blank">Media MailÂ®</a>. A delightful way to keep books moving. (Not necessarily a good thing for note-taking readers or for those for whom books are so precious that you've got <a href="https://electricliterature.com/what-are-the-rules-for-lending-your-books-to-friends/" target="_blank">these sorts of reservations</a>.
* **Donating**. To the public library...or that adorable <a href="https://littlefreelibrary.org" target="_blank">little free library</a> I intend to build.

If the result is greater than three and in the absence of personal library like <a href="https://i.insider.com/57bc93abdb5ce953008b8602" target="_blank">this</a>, evaluate for possible bibliomania.

[^1]: For a more precise approach put your to-read list through the <a href="https://howlongtoread.com" target="_blank">howlongtoread.com</a>, and add up the hours.*

Even if I were an e-readerâ€”I'm too bibliosmic to abandon hardcoversâ€”it still behooves me to be thoughtful about what I consume since it's not only shelf space that is in limited supply but more than anything time[^2].

[^2]: H/T to Tim Urban who pointed all of this out: that there's a finiteâ€”and estimableâ€”number of things you'll do in your lifetime <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html" target="_blank">(reading being no exception)</a>...a sad reality but <a href="https://twitter.com/maxjoseph/status/1121086199983157250" target="_blank">there are things to do about it</a>.

I'll keep my log [here](/books).

There are countless analogues to Tsundoku when you start thinking about it; digital ones, too: e.g. accumlating podcast episodes at a rate that outstrips your consumption. (The feature of limiting the number of downloaded episodes per podcast is just one of the many reasons to love <a href="https://www.pocketcasts.com/" target="_blank">Pocket Casts</a>â€”stay tuned for forthcoming Pocket Casts encomium.)
