And here I thought I'd explode out of the starting gate, boldly proclaiming a singular angle for this blog, but it isn't to be...just yet.

So while it percolates I guess I'll just write on a smÃ¶rgÃ¥sbord of topics as a diary of sorts for myself and my progeny: a future-proof, censor-free, character-unrestricted Twitter.

I'll begin by wishing you and yours a...

## Happy <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WorldBookDay" target="_blank">#WorldBookDay</a> ðŸ“š

...from this rather slow reader guilty of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Tsundoku" target="_blank">Tsundoku</a>.

But am I acquiring too many [books](/books/) or just not reading fast enough? Mostly the latter. Tim Urban of Wait but Why fame <a href="https://twitter.com/maxjoseph/status/1121086199983157250" target="_blank">makes an excellent case for the power of consistently reading 30 minutes per day</a>.

I could stand to be more aggressive in my reading, though: both in terms of shelving books that aren't delivering against the promise, as well as flying through certain types of books and/or certain parts of books as Ralph Waldo Emerson advocated, recorded in Robert D. Richardson, Jr.'s *Emerson: The Mind on Fire* (1995):

> Along with Emerson's freedom to take whatever struck him went the equally important obligation to ignore what did not. Emerson read widely and advised others to do so, but he was insistent about the dangers of being overwhelmed and overinfluenced by one's reading. "Do not attempt to be a great reader," he told a young Williams College student named Charles Woodbury. "Read for facts and not by the bookful." He thought one should "learn to divine books, to feel those that you want without wasting much time on them." It is only worthwhile concentrating on what is excellent and for that "often a chapter is enough." He encouraged browsing and skipping. "The glance reveals what the gaze obscures. Somewhere the author has hidden his message. Find it, and skip the paragraphs that do not talk to you."

Who knew Emerson was a speed-reader and skimmer of sorts?! But he does make such excellent points: don't peruse a self-help book as you would *The Divine Comedy*.

So that covers the throughput side of the equation, but then in the absence of a <a href="https://i.insider.com/57bc93abdb5ce953008b8602" target="_blank">majestic personal library</a> it may be necessary to prune the collection now and again, which implies *lending*â€”I love <a href="https://electricliterature.com/what-are-the-rules-for-lending-your-books-to-friends/" target="_blank">lending out books</a> whether to friends nearby or distant (thank you, <a href="https://faq.usps.com/s/article/What-is-Media-Mail-Book-Rate" target="_blank">Media Mail</a>)â€”or *donating* to a book drive or <a href="https://littlefreelibrary.org" target="_blank">little free library</a> around the corner.

"Get an ereader!" Man, I'm too tactile and bibliosmic to abandon hardcovers.
