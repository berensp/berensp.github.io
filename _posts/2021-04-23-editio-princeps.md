And here I thought I'd explode out of the starting gate, boldly proclaiming a singular angle for this blog, but it isn't to be...just yet.

So while it percolates I guess I'll just write on a smÃ¶rgÃ¥sbord of topics as a diary of sorts for myself and my progeny: a future-proof, censor-free, character-unrestricted Twitter.

Why not begin by wishing you and yours a...

## Happy <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WorldBookDay" target="_blank">#WorldBookDay</a> ðŸ“š

...from this rather slow reader guilty of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Tsundoku" target="_blank">Tsundoku</a>.

How much more meaningful would Tsundoku be as a concept if it could be quantified? Don't despair. Introducing the **To Prune Or Not To Prune Ratio**â„¢:

> `(current # of unread books on shelf + estimated acquisitions over the remainder of life) Ã· average # of books read per annum Ã· approximate # of years left on this earth (or 'til reading no longer possible)`

If the result[^1] â‰¥ one (1):
* **Donate**. To your favorite book drive or <a href="https://littlefreelibrary.org" target="_blank">little free library</a> around the corner.
* **Lend/Send**. USPS has a secret gem for us pinchpennies formerly known as Book Rate and now called <a href="https://faq.usps.com/s/article/What-is-Media-Mail-Book-Rate" target="_blank">Media MailÂ®</a>: a delightful way to stay in touch with distant family and friends, and keep books moving. (But know thyself and <a href="https://electricliterature.com/what-are-the-rules-for-lending-your-books-to-friends/" target="_blank">thy lending rules</a> first.)

In the 3+ range (and in the absence of a <a href="https://i.insider.com/57bc93abdb5ce953008b8602" target="_blank">majestic personal library</a>) get evaluated for possible <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/26/bibliomania-the-strange-history-of-compulsive-book-buying" target="_blank">bibliomania</a>.

[^1]: For a more precise approach put your to-read list through the <a href="https://howlongtoread.com" target="_blank">howlongtoread.com</a>, and add up the hours.

Even for e-readersâ€”I'm too bibliosmic[^2] to abandon hardcoversâ€”it's still advisable to be thoughtful about what you consume since it's not only shelf space that is in limited supply but more than anything time[^3].

[^2]: Should be added to my [-ic descriptors list](/about), but "reading in bed" occupies the book-related slot.

[^3]: H/T to Tim Urban who pointed all of this out: that there's a finiteâ€”and estimableâ€”number of things you'll do in your lifetime <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html" target="_blank">(reading being no exception)</a>...a sad reality but <a href="https://twitter.com/maxjoseph/status/1121086199983157250" target="_blank">there are things to do about it</a>.

There are quite a few parallels to Tsundoku when you start thinking about it; digital ones, too: e.g. accumlating podcast episodes at a rate that outstrips your consumption. (The feature of limiting the number of downloaded episodes per podcast is just one of the many reasons to love <a href="https://www.pocketcasts.com/" target="_blank">Pocket Casts</a>â€”stay tuned for forthcoming Pocket Casts encomium.)
