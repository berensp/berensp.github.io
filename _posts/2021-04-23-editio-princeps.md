And here I thought I'd explode out of the starting gate, confidently proclaiming a bold and singular angle for this forum...and...I don't particualrly have one yet.

Ergo, while it percolates I'll reserve the right to post a smörgåsbord of topics as a diary of sorts for myself and my progeny: a future-proof, censor-free, character-unrestricted Twitter.

...so why not begin by wishing you...

## Happy <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WorldBookDay" target="_blank">#WorldBookDay</a>) 📚

...from this rather slow reader guilty of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Tsundoku" target="_blank">Tsundoku</a> (Japanese: 積ん読).

How much more meaningful Tsundoku is when we can quantify with my **To Prune Or Not To Prune Ratio**™:

> `(current # of books sitting unread on the shelf + estimated acquisitions over the remainder of life) ÷ avg. # of books read per annum ÷ approximate # of years left on this earth (or 'til can no longer read)`

`If (result) > 1 {` I can consider doing some donating and/or [build my own little free library](https://littlefreelibrary.org)[^1], and if > 3 or so I might consider getting evaluated for bibliomania.

[^1]: H/T to Tim Urban who pointed all of this out: that [there's a finite—and estimable—number of things you'll do in your lifetime <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html" target="_blank">(including books read)</a>...a sad reality but <a href="https://twitter.com/maxjoseph/status/1121086199983157250" target="_blank">there are things to do about it</a>.

*NB: for a more precise approach put your to-read list through the <a href="https://howlongtoread.com" target="_blank">howlongtoread.com</a>, and add up the hours.*

Even if I were an e-reader—I'm too bibliosmic to abandon hardcovers—it still behooves me to be *intentional* (to use the modern parlance) about what I consume since it's not only shelf space that is in limited supply but more than anything time. I'll keep a log [here](/books).

There are countless analogues to Tsundoku when you start thinking about it; digital ones, too: e.g. accumlating podcast episodes at a rate that outstrips your consumption. The feature of limiting the number of downloaded episodes per podcast is just one of the many reasons to love <a href="https://www.pocketcasts.com/" target="_blank">Pocket Casts</a>—stay tuned for forthcoming Pocket Casts encomium.
