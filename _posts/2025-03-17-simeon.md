Family history has always been a fascination, and even though I started to build out <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Berens-259" target="_blank">my ancestry on WikiTree</a>[^1], I've reluctantly come to the conclusion that I don't have what it takes in the passion and tenacity departments to be an amateur genealogist.

[^1]:WikiTree seems to have their stuff together as far as <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Help:About_WikiTree" target="_blank">mission and vision</a>. (I was previously using <a href="https://www.geni.com" target="_blank">Geni</a> but it's a little clunky and the business model / monetization strategy ultimately undermines the desired network effect.)

Nevertheless, my curiosity was piqued a couple months ago when one of Mom's cousins circulated a pdf of a family tree, which was extensive and impressively wide (due to the huge Irish Catholic families).

I weaved through and found my lineage:

I knew my maternal grandfather Bob Brennan well and, being on the older end of his grandchildren, I've been privy to some details and stories about *his* parents. But, of course, those details grow sparser with each generation to the point where once you go back to Ireland (pre-emigration), key dates and spouses are altogether missing.

So looking at this genealogical tree I began wondering about "Simeon/Simon", my earliest Brennan ancestor who had a name (at least a guess at one) and a location, but nothing else to fill in his identity.

*Who was he? How was he described at his funeral? Did he have that famous Irish wit? And if 'no', then how did he woo his wife, whose name is lost to time? Etc.*

Maybe I can't piece together Simeon's documented life story via proper genealogy, but couldn't I enlist other tools of the present age to help imagine the past he inhabited? After all, "genealogy without documentation may be mythology," but mythology still has value in helping us understand ourselves, right?

Which "other tools of the present age"? Large language models, of course. First of all, just to guesstimate a birth date (based on his grandson's birthdate of February 1823), and sure enough, "based on historical marriage and childbearing patterns in rural Ireland during that period" Simeon was most likely born somewhere between 1763 and 1773[^2].

[^2]: If probably should do some fact-checking on some of this output since these early LLMs are world-class "confident b.s.ers".

And so if Simeon reached young adulthood during the late 18th century, what would life have been for him during that period?

Apparently, County Monaghan in the late 1700s was primarily agricultural, and, specifically, dominated by the linen industry (and later known for lace-making). So I wonder if Simeon was, in fact, a flax farmer? Or perhaps growing subsistence crops (potatoes, oats)? Or both? And if he grew flax was his household vertically integrated such that they did some linen weaving as well to make ends meet?

Then assuming he was a farmer—and was Catholic (as his descendants were)—he almost assuredly wouldn't have been at the top of the social/economic hierarchy since that was reserved for the Anglo-Irish Protestant landowners, one of whom would've been his landlord. So Simeon and his family probably would've been of modest means, living in perhaps a humble abode (e.g., a one-room cabin with an earthen floor and thatched roof):

<span class="muted small">How OpenAI's text-to-image model (DALL·E) imagines County Monaghan, Ireland in the late 18th century.</span>

I imagine Simeon going into the town of Monaghan on a Saturday morning to sell his produce and linen and then interact with the locals he wouldn't get a chance to see every day.

I wonder how much religious persecution Simeon would've faced? There were these Penal Laws for Catholics, which I imagine could've affected him in his youth, but were pretty well abrogated by the time he was a man. Even as the Penal Laws relaxed, though, Catholics like Simeon still faced significant barriers (e.g., no right to vote unless he met the substantial property requirement, tithe system forced Catholics [and Presbyterians] to pay for the Anglican Church), and so the United Irishmen movement would've been going on to fight for reforms, which would not have been centered in a rural place like County Monaghan, but which he still might've felt the effects of.

If I had a time machine, I'd want to run all these questions by him...and more—but would I have been able to understand him? I'm going to venture a 'yes'. Even though I'm sure his storytelling was in Irish, English in Monaghan was becoming increasingly dominant due to the linen trade and a shift in the Church toward English; so even if Simeon wasn't formally educated he probably had enough English under his belt to have a chat if I could interpret his brogue or he my funny American accent.

Simeon, if ye be in Heaven, forgive all the AI-enabled mythology I've concocted, and pray for your Brennan progeny this St. Patrick's Day.
