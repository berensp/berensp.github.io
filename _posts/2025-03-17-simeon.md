Family history has always been a fascination, and even though I started to build out <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Berens-259" target="_blank">my ancestry on WikiTree</a>[^1], I've come to the conclusion that (at least at this point in my life), I don't have the passion (follow-through) to be a genealogist.

[^1]:WikiTree seems to have their stuff together as far as <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Help:About_WikiTree" target="_blank">mission and vision</a>. (I was previously using <a href="https://www.geni.com" target="_blank">Geni</a> but it's a little clunky and the business model / monetization strategy ultimately undermines the desired network effect.)

Nevertheless, my curiosity was piqued a couple months ago when one of Mom's cousins sent around a family tree, which was extensive and totally horizontal due to the huge Irish Catholic families. I weaved through and found my lineage:

I knew my maternal grandfather Bob Brennan well, being on the older end of his grandchildren. And I've been privy to some details about *his* parents, but, of course, those details and stories grow sparser with each generation to the point where once you go back to Ireland (pre-emigration), key dates and spouses are altogether missing.

So looking at this genealogical tree I began wondering about these earliest recorded Brennans that had a name but virtually nothing else to fill in their identity. And I decided to include a large language model in my wondering—first of all to estimate a birth date for Simeon (based on his grandson's birthdate of February 1823), and sure enough, "based on historical marriage and childbearing patterns in rural Ireland during that period" Simeon was most likely born somewhere between 1763 and 1773.

And so if Simeon reached young adulthood during the late 18th century, what was life like for him?

Apparently, County Monaghan in the late 1700s was primarily agricultural, and, specifically, dominated by the linen industry (and later known for lace-making). So I wonder if Simeon was, in fact, a flax farmer? Or perhaps growing subsistence crops (potatoes, oats)? Or both? And if he grew flax was his household vertically integrated such that they did some linen weaving as well to make ends meet?

Then assuming he was a farmer—and was Catholic (as his descendants were)—he almost assuredly wouldn't have been at the top of the social/economic hierarchy since that was reserved for the Anglo-Irish Protestant landowners, one of whom would've been his landlord. So Simeon and his family would've been of modest means, living in perhaps a humble abode (e.g., a one-room cabin with an earthen floor and thatched roof):

<span class="muted small">How DALL·E imagines County Monaghan, Ireland in the late 18th century.</span>

I imagine Simeon going into the town of Monaghan on a Saturday morning to sell his produce and linen and then interact with the locals he wouldn't see every day.

I wonder how much religious persecution Simeon would've faced? There were these Penal Laws for Catholics, which I imagine could've affected him in his youth, but were pretty well abrogated by the time he was a man. Even as the Penal Laws relaxed, Catholics like Simeon still faced significant barriers (e.g., no right to vote unless he met the substantial property requirement, tithe system forced Catholics [and Presbyterians] to pay for the Anglican Church), and so the United Irishmen movement would've been going on to fight for reforms, which wouldn't've centered in a rural place like County Monaghan, but which he still might've felt the effects of.

If I had a time machine, I'd want to run all these questions by him...and more—but would I have been able to understand him? I'm going to venture a 'yes'. Even though I'm sure his storytelling was in Irish, English in Monaghan was becoming increasingly dominant due to the linen trade and a shift in the Church toward English; so even if Simeon wasn't formally educated he probably had enough English under his belt to have a chat if I could interpret his brogue or he my funny American accent.

Anyway, there are too many unknown variables for someone like me to figure out to have any confidence about who Simeon Brennan was, but at least you can do some wondering with AI.

Sláinte, Simeon. Pray for your Brennan progeny this St. Patrick's Day if ye be in Heaven!
