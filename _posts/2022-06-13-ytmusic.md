Elon Musk's tweet about YouTube and its "nonstop scam ads" generated a good amount of chatter about YouTube Premium and YouTube Music, and some good questions:

I've been on [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com/) since its Google Play Music days (2016) and it's been pretty good, but I can't imagine choosing Spotify over YouTube Music which apparently people do 3:1[^1]:

[^1]: [YouTube reports having 50 million Premium and Music subscribers](https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654318/youtube-50-million-premium-music-subscribers-streaming-services)

So I was thinking about the comparison, and if I were to score YouTube Music vs. Spotify I think it'd go like this:

- **Libraries**. <mark>Tie ü§∑‚Äç</mark>. Probably the first thing you think about: can I find the artists and songs I'm looking for? With all major players' libraries at north of 60M, this is effectively a wash and therefore differences in single-digit millions of songs is a non-factor[^2].

[^2]: Assuming your tastes are fairly conventional (mine are), and assuming that the artists that have recently cut ties with Spotify (Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, et al.) aren't all that important to you. (Joni would be a loss for me.)

- **Audio quality**. <mark4>Spotify ü•á</mark4>. At the time of this writing YT Music gets up to 256kbps whereas Spotify reaches 320kbps. I guess I'd need to do a side-by-side to see if I could hear the incremental 64kbps but my guess is I'd have a hard time appreciating the difference.

- **Music locker**. <mark3>YT Music ü•á</mark3>. I was happy to get my trove of ~3k Napster and Limewire mp3s off the external hard drive that could have a heart attack at any moment and into the cloud. YT Music offers this; Spotify does not. This is a nice perk, though I could probably safely eliminate 95+% of my collection as they're already contained within the library.

- **Discovery/Recommendations**. <mark4>Spotify ü•á</mark4>. Discovery and recommendations aren't a huge priority for me as I'm listening to a lot of Raffi these days, but actually, this comes into play with the variety and quality of selections with auto-generated playlists/"radio", and I do find a lot of repetition on YT Music (whereas I understand that Spotify does this well). (It is a little surprising that this isn't a differentiator for Google, since they acquired Songza, a phenomenal streaming and recommendation platform, back in 2014, and bolted onto Google Play Music.) Anyway, this is all admittedly anecdotal and conjectural; I don't have great data on this.

- **Podcasting**. <mark4>Spotify ü•á</mark4>. I understand Spotify's big play with podcasting from a business model/monetization perspective, but as a user I don't need podcasts and music integrated, and am too cheap to pursue premium podcast *content*; I just do the premium podcast *<a href="https://www.pocketcasts.com/plus/" target="_blank">player</a>*.

- **UI/controls/aesthetics**. <mark4>Spotify ü•á</mark4>. Mostly going on the industry point of view, but sounds like Spotify wins here, too. YT Music isn't terrible, but it's on the clunkier side.

- **Ecosystem** (i.e. accepted more places). <mark4>Spotify ü•á</mark4>. More and more in our connected/IoT world the ecosystem matters, and so I think Spotify has a slight edge in terms of the number of third party services and devices you can connect to (e.g. Sonos, various car audio systems, Waze, Alexa).

- **Social/Sharing**. <mark4>Spotify ü•á</mark4>. This clearly goes to Spotify, but it's also not terribly important to me. (Though maybe I don't know what I'm missing.)

...Okay, the count so far is 6-1-1 in favor of Spotify, but then the one dimension that disproportionately sends it all the way back in favor of YT Music:

## Deciding factor

- **Ad-free YouTube**. <mark3>YT Music ü•á</mark3>. Ad-free, offline (i.e. downloads), and background play. I know: you kind of wince at having to pay YouTube to not be subjected to ad bombardment. YouTube is that school bully who exacts a toll from kids' packed lunches should they wish to avoid a beatdown. But hey, that's capitalism and willingness to pay. And when I think about the quantity of product reviews, educational videos, home improvement tutorials, and wild animal videos I consume, there's a significant time savings (ergo value).

I'm not totally sure I need to have a music streaming service‚ÄîI could conceivably be satisfied rotating among my top 50 albums of all time (future post to enumerate)‚Äîbut while I do it'd be hard to give up ad-free YouTube. At the end of the day this just indicates that I may enjoy music, but I'm no *audiophile*.
