Today marks 15 years for me in San Francisco.

<span class="muted small">Baker Beach, December 2013.</span>

I was sold (hoodwinked) on this place after spending a glorious weekend here with some *unseasonably warm* weather one autumn—thanks, Steph and Annie.

It's a magnificent city—and simultaneously a broken one[^1]—but since I have *rosy retrospection* (or *nostalgia bias*) I lean toward the positive side of the two. Because ultimately, I don't experience SF as Forbes ranking; but rather as a mosaic of relationships and experiences with a backdrop and soundtrack and supporting cast of eccentric characters being this city:

- I've made wonderful friends here. Lost a few dear ones. Married my best one.
- Two beautiful children were born to us in this city—thank you, CPMC.
- Speaking of medical professionals, [Lisa's life was saved](/sept-11.html) here in a way that may have been unlikely elsewhere. And my crazy eye problems were resolved by one of the best eye surgeons on this side of the Mississippi.
- Beautiful neighborhoods (and neighbors) in Potrero Hill, Laurel Heights, and Forest Hill.
- Exceptional Catholic parishes (and the friendships born therein): St. Dominic's and Star of the Sea
- Raw beauty. The Presidio, Golden Gate Park, Grandview Park, Crissy Field, Lyon Street Steps, Twin Peaks. (It's an endless list.)
- The fog[^2]
- A magical place for a tech enthusiast like yours truly. I have to concur with Om Malik[^3]:
  > In San Francisco, technologies, new ideas, and people collide randomly in the oddest of places, at the oddest of times. Much of this has to do with the density of techies. In a way, that in itself is a self-fulling [sic] destiny
- So many great pubs and bistros and coffee shops and live music venues (thanks to Billy).
- And, I mean, if you haven't ever had fresh Rice-A-Roni...

[^2]: The fog (a.k.a. <a href="https://x.com/KarlTheFog" target="_blank">Karl</a>) is the charm of San Francisco: rolling through the hills, hanging high in the eucalyptus trees, shrouding cityscapes and [entire bridges](/assets/og/ggb.jpg), and keeping it nice 'n' cool for [running](/running/) and [cycling](/cycling/).

How do you adequately mark such a milestone (especially given the uncertainty of making it to the next multiple-of-five anniversary)? You take your very first Ocean Beach plunge:
