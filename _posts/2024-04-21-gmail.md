Twenty years ago today, when Gmail was still in public beta, I snagged an invite from [@rhomsany](https://twitter.com/rhomsany)—thanks again, Sir.

It's hard to remember, but Gmail upended the prevailing concept of personal email by offering an unfathomable amount of storage (1GB instead of the typical 10-15MB), and the said 'forget about filing and hunting for messages; just keep everything and use our world-class search'. The press release positioned Gmail as being ["built on the idea that users should never have to file or delete a message"](https://googlepress.blogspot.com/2004/04/google-gets-message-launches-gmail.html). 

Being early, I got my surname name as my handle, and I've been punished for my hubris with a pretty steady stream of misdirected mail from the US, Germany, and Holland to every Berens you can imagine *(Hallo ______, ich bin nicht der Herr Berens, den Sie suchen. Grüße)*.

Otherwise all went well with Gmail serving as my primary personal email addie. The product consistently improved with each passing year. It also hit a ubiquity where it signaled you were not a total luddite—or, at least, that you had people in your life who loved you enough to prevent you from looking like a luddite.

But I kept piling message on message. Until I received this notification early 2022:

Notice the suggestion in blue font: *Delete files to free up space.* What?! What happened to *you'll never need to delete an email again?*

By 18 April 2022, three days before my 18th Gmail anniversary I subscribed to [Google One](https://one.google.com/) under duress. And as of today, just two years later, I've burned through 43% of my Google One storage. 

We're all waking up to this bait and switch. Ezra Klein [recently described this same problem](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/07/opinion/gmail-email-digital-shame.html), which caused him to ditch Gmail and join Hey in an effort to tack in a new direction with regard to his email management. I feel I should do likewise.

With other areas of digital life I've tried to avoid platform risk:
- **Blogging.** Blog here on my own domain, instead of Medium or Substack whose prices and longevity I have no control over
- **Social Media.** I'm now using web3 social media (Farcaster) more than web2 social media (Twitter), the latter of which is not just the service provider but the he sole arbiter of . Also, when you are deplatformed or quit, you can't take your social graph with you, so I fastidiously maintain my own rolodex (e.g., I don't have to rely on Facebook for birthdays).
- **Musical Recordings.** Keep my musical creations in mp3 (or some standard audio format) and instead of on a SoundCloud where one could be held for ransom
- **Genealogy.** Contribute to open platforms like WikiTree instead of proprietary tools like Ancestry.com or Geni.com

While I do use email from my own domain now, I'm running it through Gmail instead of hosting my own email server—which is really what I should be doing. But then you run into the issue of deliverability where Gmail, Outlook, et al. assume you're spam and just bin the emails you send.

No matter what the kids say, email is still the king of asynchronous communication and Gmail is its paragon. Thanks, Google, for the 20 years of what is decidedly a great product—even if I've paid for it with my data.

...I just need a plan for where to go from here.
