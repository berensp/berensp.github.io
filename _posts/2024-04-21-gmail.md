Twenty years ago today, when Gmail was still in public beta, I snagged an invite from [@rhomsany](https://twitter.com/rhomsany)—thanks again, Sir.

It's hard to remember, but Gmail upended the prevailing concept of personal email by offering what was an unfathomable amount of storage (1GB instead of the typical 10-15MB), and then said *forget about filing and hunting for messages; just keep everything and use our world-class search*. The press release positioned Gmail as being ["built on the idea that users should never have to file or delete a message"](https://googlepress.blogspot.com/2004/04/google-gets-message-launches-gmail.html). 

Being early to the party, I got my surname name as my handle—although I've been punished for my hubris ever since with a steady stream of misdirected mail from the US, Germany, and Holland *(Hallo ______, ich bin nicht der Herr Berens, den Sie suchen. Grüße)*.

Otherwise I was very happy to have made the switch to Gmail as my primary personal email service. The product consistently improved with each passing year. It also became popular enough that having a Gmail account indicated you weren't completely out of touch.

But as the years rolled by, messages piled on top of messages. Until I received this notification early 2022:

Notice the suggestion in blue font: *Delete files to free up space.* Huh? What happened to *you'll never need to delete an email again?*

Several days before my 18th Gmail anniversary I found myself subscribing to [Google One](https://one.google.com/)...under duress. And as of today, just two years later, I've burned through 43% of my Google One storage. 

We're all waking up to this bait and switch. Ezra Klein [recently described this same problem](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/07/opinion/gmail-email-digital-shame.html), which caused him to ditch Gmail and join Hey in an effort to tack in a new direction with regard to his email management. I should probably do likewise.

Over time, in other areas of digital life I've tried to avoid platform risk:
- **Blogging.** [Post simple Markdown files here on my own domain](/this-site), instead of using Medium or Substack or some other blog platform whose prices and longevity I have no control over
- **Social Media.** Use web3 social media ([Farcaster](https://www.farcaster.xyz/)) more than web2 social media (Twitter), the latter of which is not just the service provider but also the sole arbiter of content moderation, data ownership, and platform governance. Also, when you quit (or are deplatformed), you can't take your social graph with you, so I fastidiously maintain my own (exportable) rolodex in Google Contacts (i.e., I don't have to rely on Facebook for birthdays).
- **Musical Recordings.** Keep my [musical creations](/plastic-jesus/) in mp3 (or some standard audio format) and instead of on a SoundCloud where one could be held for ransom
- **Genealogy.** [Contribute to an open platform like WikiTree](/ancestry/) instead of proprietary tools like Ancestry.com or Geni.com

But DIY email is harder. While I do use email from my own domain now, I'm running it through Gmail instead of hosting my own email server, the latter probably being the gold standard of tech independence. But then you run into the issue of deliverability where Gmail, Outlook, et al. assume you're spam and just bin the emails you send. A conundrum.

No matter what the kids say, email is still the king of asynchronous communication, and Gmail is its paragon. Thanks, Google, for the 20 years of what is decidedly a great product—even if I've paid for it with my data.

...I just need a plan for where to go from here.
