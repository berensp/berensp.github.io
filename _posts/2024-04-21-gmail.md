Twenty years ago today, when Gmail was still in public beta, I snagged an invite from [@rhomsany](https://twitter.com/rhomsany)—thanks again, Sir.

It was a departure from the prevailing stingy concept of email (e.g., I think my Yahoo account was around 15 megabytes?). Google said "forget about *filing* your messages into folders because search—what we do best—will surface that message again in a heartbeat; and forget about *deleting* messages because we're going to give you an incredible amount of space (1GB)." In fact, at launch Gmail was advertised as "you'll never need to delete an email again."

Being early, I got my surname name as my handle, and I've been pretty consistently punished for my hubris with misdirected mail from the US, Germany, and Holland *(Hallo ______, ich bin nicht der Herr Berens, den Sie suchen. Grüße)*.

Well, Gmail has evolved over the two decades to be an excellent email provider not to mention it signaling that you're a well-adjusted member of the professional managerial class. And it seems the secret is out with 1.2B users on the platform.

Years went by and all was well.

But I kept piling message on message. Until I received this notification early 2022:

Notice the suggestion: "Delete files to free up space." What happened to "you'll never need to delete an email again"?

By 18 April 2022, three days before my 18th anniversary I had given in and subscribed to [Google One](https://one.google.com/) under duress. And as of today, just years later, I've burned through 43% of my Google One storage. 

We're all waking up to this bait and switch. Ezra Klein [recently described this same problem](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/07/opinion/gmail-email-digital-shame.html), which caused him to ditch Gmail and join Hey in an effort to take an entirely different approach to his email management.

With other platforms I've tried to avoid being held for ransom:
- Blogging. Blog here on my own domain, instead of Medium or Substack whose prices and longevity I have no control over
- Social Media. I'm now using web3 social media (Farcaster) more than web2 social media (Twitter), the latter of which can deplatform you and you have no say. Also, when you are deplatformed or quit, you can't take your social graph with you, so I fastidiously maintain my own rolodex (e.g., I generally don't have to rely on Facebook for birthdays).
- Keep my musical creations in mp3 (or some standard audio format) and instead of on a SoundCloud
- Contribute to open platforms like WikiTree instead of proprietary tools like Ancestry.com or Geni.com

While I use email from my own domain now, I'm running it through Gmail instead of hosting my own email server—which is really what I should be doing. But then you run into the issue of deliverability where Gmail, Outlook, et al. assume you're spam and just bin the emails you send.

No matter what the kids say, email is still the king of asynchronous (i.e., texting is best left for the urgent), and Gmail is the behemoth. Thanks for the 20 years of what is decidedly a great product—even if I've paid for it with my data...I just need a plan for where to go from here.
