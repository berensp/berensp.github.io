title: Delighters and Actionable Insights

I've been consistently tracking my [runs](/running/) and [rides](/cycling/) on Strava since February 2012, but I have to say that my favorite feature is an understated one: **shoe mileage tracking**.

It's very simple, actually: if I add my running shoe model to the My Gear section of my profile, Strava will log each of my run activities against this pair, and then notify me once the total mileage has reached 400 miles‚Äîa configurable target distance...

...so that I can use data to justify purchasing some new kicks before injury occurs!

Joking aside, this is nontrivial to me, because I have had my share of running-related knee and shin and foot woes, some of which were attributable to going too far in shoes whose midsoles I had already stomped out.

So it's an insight which I find valuable. And the mechanism is a convenient one, since the alternative to this tracker is some kind of manual tracking, which, honestly, ain't gonna happen.

Ergo high user value (at least for me) + $0 (included) = *delighter feature* per the Kano Model; a useful, albeit not-terribly-quantitatively-rigorous framework.

## The Kano Model for feature prioritization

- **Must-haves.** Table stakes (or "main variable" [h/t to Christie Nordhielm's Big Picture marketing framework]). Prioritize these highest, and implement early in product lifecycle. Typically don't monetize directly.
	- Example from my Google Pixel 8 Pro: pretty much anything you require of any smartphone (e.g., calling, texting, GPS, access to an app store, etc.).
- **Performance features.** Focus on these after basics are covered. Prioritize based on cost-benefit analysis. Can be monetized individually, especially via tiered pricing models.
	- Example from my Google Pixel 8 Pro: probably something to do with its camera and photo quality as that's one of the key areas of differentiation.
- **Delighters.** (a.k.a. "excitement features"). Product differentiators and the best ones are disproportionately high customer satisfaction (delight) relative to investment. May be potentially monetizable as premium features.
	- Example from my Google Pixel 8 Pro: Google Recorder (AI-enabled voice recording app) being available only to Pixel users.

Which makes me wonder:
- Does the shoe tracker feature segment convert (to premium) better?
- Do they have better retention?
- How much it might impact NPS/customer sat (are others as delighted as I)?
- What kind of willingness to pay might exist?

## Actionable Insights

I admit it's a bit hackneyed, but if these bad boys hit the mark (in terms of some combination of targeting, timing, relevance, utility), they're gold from a user experience and customer satisfaction perspective .

The Shoe Mileage Tracker fits into this category: i.e., information derived from some set of data that may be useful to the user for some decision or action. Although, a key difference is that I signed up for the shoe tracking (in the same way you might set an alarm), whereas other apps in other situations will serve up a notification or message *unsolicited,* which could land anywhere on the continuum between annoying spam and delightful insight-nugget, depending on how I receive it.

The email marketers over at Credit Karma have done this well for quite some time (despite dealing with boring subject matter):

#1 They get right to the point:

> Hey Paul, we noticed your JPMCB CARD card balance has gradually gone down these past three months.

#2 Follow it with why I should care and context:

> Creditors love to see this kind of patter, because it shows that you can make your monthly payments.

#3 End with a call to action:

> In the meantime, head to Credit Karma for a closer look.

Truth be told, I don't particularly care about this insight, so maybe it's not perfectly targeted, but the point is that the template works. *And* this is probably just algorithmic (i.e., query users of x,y,z demographics whose card balance has decreased by a certain percentage or absolute dollar amount for three consecutive months), but imagine how much more pertinent and nuanced these will be once AI models can perfect them.

## The Future

As I say, AI is going to take this to the next level, and it may be that algorithmic insights won't cut it forever. In fact, they may well move down the Kano curve from delighter to basic feature‚Äîor worse, the "indifferent" category, because of, for example, *hyper-personalization* (tidbits even more tailored to me) and *predictive/prescriptive insights* (what's my best course of action based on how the model forecasts the future).

But there's plenty of runway in the time being with the crude insights, so keep going, Shoe Mileage Tracking Product Manager ü´°
