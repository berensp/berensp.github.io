I've been consistently tracking my [runs](/running/) and [rides](/cycling/) on Strava since February 2012, but I have to say that my favorite feature is an understated one: **The Shoe Mileage Tracker**.

It's very simple, actually: add your running shoe model to the My Gear section of your profile ‚Üí Strava logs each run activity against this pair ‚Üí and then notifies you once the accumulated mileage has reached your (configurable) target distance comme ci:

...so that you have a data-informed justification for purchasing the new kicks:

Actually, this is nontrivial to me, because I've had my share of running-related knee and shin and foot injuries, some of which were attributable to going too far in shoes whose midsoles I had already stomped out.

So, it's an insight which I find valuable. And the mechanism is a convenient one, since the alternative to this tracker is some kind of manual tracking, which, honestly, ain't gonna happen.

Ergo high user value (at least for me) + $0 (included) = *delighter feature* per the Kano Model; a useful, albeit not-terribly-quantitatively-rigorous framework.

## The Kano Model for feature prioritization

![Kano Model](/assets/og/kano.png)

- **Must-haves.** Table stakes (or "Main Variable" [h/t to Christie Nordhielm's Big Picture marketing framework]). Prioritize these highest and implement early in product lifecycle. Typically don't monetize directly.
	- Example from my Google Pixel 8 Pro: pretty much anything you require of any smartphone (e.g., calling, texting, GPS, access to an app store, etc.).
- **Performance features.** Focus on these after basics are covered. Prioritize based on cost-benefit analysis. Can be monetized individually, especially via tiered pricing models.
	- Example from my Google Pixel 8 Pro: probably something to do with its camera and photo quality as that's one of the key areas of differentiation.
- **Delighters.** (a.k.a. "excitement features"). Product differentiators and the best ones are disproportionately high customer satisfaction (delight) relative to investment. May be potentially monetizable as premium features.
	- Example from my Google Pixel 8 Pro: Google Recorder (AI-enabled voice recording app) being available only to Pixel users.

### Which makes me wonder:
- Does the shoe mileage tracker feature segment convert (to premium) better?
- Do they have superior retention?
- How much might the shoe mileage tracker impact NPS/customer sat (i.e., are other users as delighted as I)?
- What kind of willingness to pay might exist?

## Value-unlocking, Data-centric, Paradigmatically-disruptive Actionable Insights

I admit: *actionable insights* is pretty hackneyed‚Äînot to mention redundant‚Äîbut if these bad boys hit the mark (in terms of some combination of targeting, timing, relevance, utility), they're gold from a user experience and customer satisfaction perspective.

The Shoe Mileage Tracker fits into this category: i.e., information derived from some set of data that may be useful to the user for some decision or action. Although, a key difference is that I had to proactively enable the shoe mileage tracking (in the same way you might set an alarm), whereas other apps in other situations will serve up a notification or message *unsolicited,* which could land anywhere on the continuum between annoying spam and delightful insight-nugget, depending on how I receive it.

The email marketers over at Credit Karma have taken the unsolicited approach‚Äîand done it well‚Äîfor quite some time (despite dealing with boring subject matter). Here's a good example from them:

<center><img src="/assets/og/phone_credit-karma.png" alt="credit karma example actionable insight" style="width: 60%;"></center>

#1 *bam*‚Äîthey hit you right between the eyes with the insight:

> Hey Paul, we noticed your JPMCB CARD card balance has gradually gone down these past three months.

#2 But why I should care and what's the context here, Man?

> Creditors love to see this kind of pattern, because it shows that you can make your monthly payments.

#3 The summoning (call to action):

> In the meantime, head to Credit Karma for a closer look.

Truth be told, it's hard for me to care about this particular insight, but the point is that the template works. *And* this is probably just algorithmic (i.e., query users of x,y,z demographics whose card balance has decreased by a certain percentage or absolute dollar amount for three consecutive months), but imagine how much more powerful (relevant, interesting) these will be once AI models can perfect them.

## The Future

As I say, AI is going to take this to the next level, and it may be that algorithmic insights won't cut it forever. In fact, they may well move down the Kano curve from delighter to basic feature‚Äîor worse, the "indifferent" category‚Äîbecause of new trends that will raise the bar like, for example, *hyper-personalization* (tidbits even more tailored to me) and *predictive/prescriptive insights* (what's my best course of action based on how the model forecasts the future).

But I'd say there's plenty of runway left for the crude insights, so keep going, Shoe Mileage Tracker Product Manager ü´°
