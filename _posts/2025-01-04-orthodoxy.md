*"Do not conform yourselves to this age but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and pleasing and perfect."* (—Roman 12:2)

When I was growing in Saint Paul, Minnesota; it was the Mecca of post-Vatican II contemporary Catholic music (i.e. *Glory & Praise* and *Gather*). Mom was actually a member of this scene, attending workshops with Marty Haugen, David Haas, Fr. Michael Joncas, et al.[^1] 

[^1]: It's amazing (in a nerdy kinda way) how the Twin Cities became the epicenter of contemporary Catholic music, but there's a huge list of composers hailing from (or at least connected to) the Minneapolis/St. Paul: Sr. Delores Dufner, Daniel Kantor, Lynn Trapp, Tony Alonso, Lori True, Donna Pena, Msgr. Richard Schuler, Richard Proulx, et al.

At our parish, we'd have guitars strummin' to favorites like *Anthem*:

> We are called, we are chosen.  
We are Christ for one another.  
We are promised to tomorrow,  
while we are for him today.  
We are sign, we are wonder.  
We are sower, we are seed.  
We are harvest, we are hunger.  
We are question, we are creed.

Then at age 16 I learned guitar, and by the time I was in college, I found *myself* being the guitar-strummin' guy at the guitar Masses. Couple that with my formation in the Faith, both in high school and at my Jesuit university, and I was your average liberal Catholic fella. In fact, you can fast-forward all through my adulthood to the Contemporary Choir at St. Dominic's in San Francisco where my liturgical guitar-strummin' made me cross paths with my now wife—*Deo Gratias!*

But a few things converged for me a few years into married life:
1. A self-consciousness of certain shortcomings of my music ministry: e.g., difficulty with focus during Mass; a feeling of *performing* more than *worshipping*; questions about reverence (e.g., I'm standing on the altar, back to the tabernacle)...none of it malicious; but still concerning.
2. A deepening faith—or at least desire for it—aided by our parish, my own spiritual reading, and various friends/acquaintances
3. Kids + pandemic took us out of music ministry, and out of California altogether for a while

...and so when we returned to California in Spring 2021 we switched parishes to Star of the Sea, a traditional parish in the Richmond District of SF. I had actually discovered Star the year prior as I was Tridentine-curious, but once we joined the parish we attended the "ordinary form" due to the timeslot, however, it's still orthodox in all respects.

## Why Orthodoxy?
There are all kinds of little things I found attractive about the traditional Catholicism (e.g., at Star of the Sea): *ad orientem*[^2],Communion at the rail and on the tongue from a priest, Gregorian chant/sacred polyphony, the space for silence, a reverent congregation in Sunday attire, etc. It stirred my soul; and the funny thing is that we were already at an objectively stunning church, perhaps the most beautiful in San Francisco.[^3]

[^2]: People sometimes attack this by saying the celebrant has his back to the congregation (as is disrespectful). But it really makes a lot of sense when you think that we're all (priest included) facing liturgical East to offer up prayer together to God.

[^3]: In this way, it reminds me of Evelyn Waugh's [*Brideshead Revisited*](/books/brideshead/), going from one transcendental (the beautiful) to another (the true)—to not disparage St. Dominic's, but rather to lift up Star of the Sea as something that radiates, thanks to the blessing of Our Lady, Stella Maris (perhaps in response to 24-hour adoration and other devotions).

But the deeper why to me is about cognitive dissonance...or, in reality, reducing it.

Consider that ~70% of US Catholics don't believe in the Real Substance (transubstantiation). You might suppose that's the result of society becoming more scentific ergo more materialistic. Or perhaps a catechetical failure. Both probably partly explain it. But I believe there's a liturgical factor. Shia LaBeouf became Catholic not so long ago (and a TLM adherent as well) and noted the strange juxtaposition of casual preaching with the sublimeness of the sacrament ("letting your hair down right before you're asking me to fully believe that we're about to walk through the death of Christ")[^4]. I fully agree (for myself): my brain is decidedly not agile enough to pivot between homily jokes and inexhaustible mystery breaking through the veil, and I think, the traditional liturgy is meant to spare us from that manoeuvre.

[^4]: I do believe Vatican II is partly to blame. Whether it was ill-conceived or just poorly (or only partially) implemented, I'm not qualified to weigh in on the debate as I don’t have a Licentiate in Sacred Theology.

Reminds me of Annie Dillard's quote[^5]:

[^5]: I jettisoned the latter part of the quote about crash helmets and life preservers and signal flares, which has more comic than theological value.

> On the whole, I do not find Christians, outside of the catacombs, sufficiently sensible of conditions. Does anyone have the foggiest idea what sort of power we so blithely invoke? Or, as I suspect, does no one believe a word of it...

At one of the parishes I've attended with my parents, everyone just remains standing during the Eucharistic Prayer, which is sanctioned but presents a problem in that your posture belies the reality, and so your brain gets mixed up.

Not just posture but dress. If I opt for the shirt 'n' tie over the Vikings jersey it shows respect, conveys how important I think it is, and then behavior conforms as well *(vestis virum facit)*.

## Not holier than thou...quite the opposite
The stereotype regarding the "traditionalists"—or pick your moniker of those attending more conservative parishes—is that they are too cool for school; holier than thou; supercilious. I'm sure that's the case in certain places, but the opposite of what I've found at Star...maybe because traditionalists are aware of the stereotype and work all the harder for their own humility.

As for me, I'm just a sinner who's working out his salvation with fear and trembling. No lie. There's a Jungian principle called *Enantiodromia,* a running contrariwise. When a sapling is bent in one direction, you don't just push on it; you pull hard from the other side until it's straight. That's kinda me with the Faith: I went seriously off course—that's as much as a confession as you're going to get, Reader—and I believe the Holy Spirit helped me find a traditional parish to "bend back". And I'm sure I'll be doing so for years to come, God willing.

I might liken it to cycling: I love riding with stronger cyclists because when you've got someone to chase, someone to pull you up the climbs; you end up riding harder and stronger. Similarly, when a large segment of your parish is pretty committed to their faith lives, it helps you with your own piety (a virtuous cycle or flywheel).

You might say: that's great, Paul, but these are all just stylistic preferences—strawberry vs. vanilla—so you do you. I mean, I think people can have different sensibilities about worship just like they can about anything else in life, and I don't wish to demean more liberal parishes, which a) most of my loved ones attend b) probably constitute the vast majority of parishes in this country, and c) are likely the biggest on-ramp into the Faith for converts.

But I also think we're dealing with something with immense importance: the Mass isn't just some nice piety; it's our lifeline (Jn 6:53). But isn't Catholic conservatism just clinging to old comforts and tradition for its own sake, mainly because its adherents are afraid or skeptical of change? I'd argue that no, it's ultimately in service of the truth, and I see its effects. And yes, it's now counter-cultural and weird and uncool, but I'm with St. Alphonsus Liguori:

> Do not consider what others do, or how they do it; for there are but few who really work for their own sanctification.
