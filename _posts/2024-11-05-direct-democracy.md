Today marks the 60th quadrennial presidential election; which sounds like a grand affair, worthy of celebration; and yet here we are with our two somewhat underwhelming presidential candidates. *Sigh*.

And yet as I complete my ballot (with my trusty sidekick [see below]), as many Californians and San Franciqueños will tell you, you need to spend more (or much more) time thinking about and working on the *propositions* than on the *candidates*. And that's because of this crazy style of government we've got here in California and locally: **the direct democracy**.

"Direct democracy" sounds great, right? After all, America is a bastion of *democracy,* and going *direct* to the people indicates a purity, that nothing should be lost in translation. 

But it turns out it's terrible. Our founders knew this and discussed in the Federalist Papers and elsewhere. But nevertheless, here in Calfornia this ill-conceived experiment has been run continuously since 1911.

Exempli gratia from our ballot:

> **Proposition 2.** Authorizes $10 billion in general obligation bonds for repair, upgrade, and construction of facilities at K–12 public schools (including charter schools), community colleges, and career technical education programs, including for improvement of health and safety conditions and classroom upgrades. Requires annual audits. *Fiscal Impact:* Increased state costs of about $500 million annually for 35 years to repay the bond. *Supporters:* California Teachers Association; California School Nurses Organization; Community College League of California *Opponents:* Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association

This is common—in fact at a local level we've got the same thing (Prop A): *Do you want us to put a bunch of money into [insert noble enterprise like K-12 schools]? I mean, you don't hate our school-aged children, do you?* (Nevermind that school facility maintenance is among the very first line items the government is supposed to have on the budget, paid for with our existing taxes.)

But even if you thought it was a laudable proposal, a worthwhile investment; how would you evaluate it? First, is there truly a need? Perhaps. How did it get sized to a nice, round $10,000,000,000.00? What happens if we don't do it? Does it get funded another way? Etc.

I have attempted to "go deep" on this or that proposition in the past: get both sides' arguments and counterarguments, seek out as much analysis as possible, do my own due diligence with some source material, etc. It takes a fair amount of time. And we have 25 propositions between state and local this time around.

And even once you've arrived at your well-informed answer and your confidence is brimming, you realize another problem: how does everything hang together in a fiscal budget? It's hard to see it, and you're typically not making tradeoffs on these props; rather they're simply binary choices: do the thing or don't. So it's easy to say "yes" but not fully understand the ROI or how everything else in the budget might be adjusted to accommodate said proposition.

You know, it's almost like you'd want a small group of people whom the *demos* trusts and feels would be competent and fair-minded to represent us in deciding such matters.

There are occasions when the features of direct democracy are useful. Like when you have to recall a district attorney whose woke ideologies come to be at odds with the very duties he's elected to carry out. And there are places in the world where it seems to work out: like Liechtenstein...though they also have a total population similar to that of the Outer Richmond neighborhood of San Francisco, so go figure.

But for the most part, when we look at California, we should conclude that the democratic republic or some form of representative democracy—and not the direct democracy—is the way to go.
