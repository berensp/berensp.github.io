description: Let's bring back Pascal's Wager.

Polish-American poet and Nobel laureate Czesław Miłosz once observed[^1]:

[^1]: Czesław Miłosz, *Roadside Dog* (New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1998), 22.

> Religion used to be the opium of the people. To those suffering humiliation, pain, illness, and serfdom, religion promised the reward of an after life. But now, we are witnessing a transformation, a true opium of the people is the belief in nothingness after death, the huge solace, the huge comfort of thinking that for our betrayals, our greed, our cowardice, our murders, we are not going to be judged.

The solace of nihilism might be a stretch for the average bloke, but if you include or substitute in "absolution", Miłosz captures something profound here: we've flipped the script on religious comfort or uncomfortable realities. Where faith once consoled the suffering masses with promises of ultimate justice, now the "opium" is the belief that there are no ultimate consequences at all. This shift reveals something deeper about human nature: our tendency to flee from uncomfortable truths, especially when they make demands on our lives.

Blaise Pascal noted that "people arrive at beliefs based on what they find attractive," as opposed to what's inherently true ([see Safetyism post](/safetyism)). And so in Catholicism we get the proverbial "Cafeteria Catholic" who accepts what is convenient, tolerable, easy; discarding the rest. The refrain is "well, the God <u>I</u> believe in..." and fill in the rest of the sentence with an idol of comfort/convenience to justify whatever you care to and avoid anything that would imply a serious life course correction. And we do it without realizing it, though I think prayer exposes the areas of intellectual dishonesty to our conscience.

So here's my central argument: <mark>while we've watered down the faith in recent decades, real Christianity presents genuinely difficult truths that drive people away for understandable reasons. But the stakes involved—potentially infinite and eternal—are too high to simply avoid. Even if Christianity's positive case doesn't compel you, Pascal's Wager provides the minimum rational framework any honest person should consider when facing questions of ultimate consequence.</mark>

## Uncomfortable Christian Truth Claims

A couple months ago at Disneyland, walking with the morning crowds from the hotels toward the park entrance, we encountered a street preacher with a megaphone proclaiming the gospel. Predictably, everyone ignored him and/or quickened their pace. But being the theologically-curious one, I found myself listening carefully to his message, and then, surprisingly, agreeing with almost everything he said. It occurred to me that people weren't necessarily rejecting his theology; they were out of hand rejecting his delivery: a blaring sermon at 09:00 before the coffee has activated and as you're trying to decide which ride to hit up first makes it all too easy to dismiss. But strip away the off-putting presentation, and you're left with core Christian claims that are just as challenging whether delivered by a street preacher or a seminary professor: you need salvation, judgment is real, your life isn't your own, etc. It's a perfect illustration of our broader problem with uncomfortable truths: we're quite good as a species at dismissing difficult messages based on how they're packaged rather than whether they're accurate.

I'm no expert evangelist, but I'd imagine the strategy is to lead with the more winsome concepts (e.g., the unconditional *(agapic)* love of Christ), but there are concomitant truths and realities of the Good News that we selectively edit out. Take, for example, Christ challenging the Pharisees when they brought him the woman caught in adultery: "Let him who is without sin cast the first stone" (John 8:7). Awesome. Don't judge, Man! But you need to keep reading, because the whole exchange ends with Him telling her "Go, [and] from now on do not sin any more" (John 8:11)—*oh, Man, couldn't He have just stopped right there with the zinger; now there's this additional, life-alterating command.*

Some examples of specifics truth claims we don't easily acknowledge:
- **Personal autonomy challenges.**
	- A.k.a. Your life is not about you, as Bishop Barron is wont to say. Well, what is life about then? Family, relationships, making an impact, leaving the world a better place, etc., right? Christianity says "whoever loses his life will find it". Whoa. That sounds like a threat to self-determination if there ever was one.
	- Suffering as the path to love. Again, paradoxical. You'd think following Christ would yield happiness in this life, and yet, "Woe to you when all speak well of you".
- **Intellectual humility demands.** God's ways are often incomprehensible. But what if God were up to things that we didn't/couldn't understand...despite how wicked smaht we agh? "Yes, the heavens are as high above the earth as my ways are above your ways, and my thoughts above your thoughts." (Is 55:9). The Book of Job gets into these topics of trusting beyond understanding, and potentially intellectual pride.
- **Universal judgment claims.** Narrow is the road to heaven (Matthew 7:14). The exclusivity of salvation *(Extra ecclesiam nulla salus)* is a difficult one, and flies in the face of pluralism, but St. Faustina's visions confirm that the lake of fire isn't empty. Jesus says, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me." but Karl Rahner provided a loophole via the Anonymous Christian and *Votum Ecclesiae*. The problem may be that educated people in today's global society may not have the scapegoat of invincible ignorance the way the proverbial Amazonian tribe cut off from society might.
- **Objective morality and sin.**
	- The Metaphysics of Sin. Since the gravity of an offense is measured partly by the dignity of the one offended, you can say that sins against the infinitely perfect God take on a kind of infinite character that finite satisfaction cannot fully address. Hence, you need a savior because you aren't going to pull yourself up by your own bootstraps (soteriologically speaking). I didn't understand this well growing up, which is why your average "nice person" assumes he's heaven-bound.
	- Moral truths. Objective actions primarily determine mortal sin because the law is written on the heart of man (cf Rom 1.), which torpedoes plausible deniability. "Officer, I didn't know I couldn't do that." Truth as universal and objective and knowable (through faith and reason) challenges our postmodern, relativistic culture ("your truth" vs. "my truth"). This is why it's a terrible mistake to presume God's mercy.

## Enter the Wager

So how do we handle discomfort? Head on. Isn't that the "anti-fragile" philosophy (to borrow Nassim Nicholas Taleb's language) or Jordan Peterson's "embrace the struggle" philosophy (borrowed from Jung's "shadow self")?

A dear friend and I discovered many years ago that we were both *apeirophobes* (I can't recall who confessed to whom), but I've realized most recently that I'm really a *stygiophobe*. But, seriously, with all of our stimulation and distraction in this day and age, you can't ruminate on anything for five minutes...and yet, I challenge you to take five minutes and consider the idea of eternal life (I have to moderate this activity before anxiety/panic strikes). This isn't like another hundred-year lifetime, or a few of them, or a million years; this is e t e r n i t y[^2]...

[^2]: I realize the Catholic/Christian afterlife is most correctly conceived as existing *outside of time* as opposed to living in a timeline forever and ever like a vampire—hence the panicky feeling for us mortal creatures situated here in time—but still, eternity is a scary concept!

You know who did this: who followed his atheism all the way to its logical conclusions? Friedrich Nietzsche. Most atheists and existentialists were/are too lazy or cowardly to do this, but he is a shining example. Now, he *did* end up in the loony bin, and you can draw your own conclusions about that, but I give him a lot of credit for his consistency and commitment.

Now, I propose: let's revive Pascal's Wager:

<style>
.matrix-table {
    border-collapse: collapse;
}

.axis-label {
    font-weight: bold;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 10px;
    border: 1px solid black;
    background-color: #f8f8f8;
}

.matrix-cell {
    width: 120px;
    height: 120px;
    text-align: center;
    vertical-align: middle;
    border: 1px solid black;
}

.empty-cell {
    border: none;
}
</style>

<table class="matrix-table">
    <tr>
        <td class="axis-label empty-cell"></td>
        <td class="axis-label">God exists (G)</td>
        <td class="axis-label">God does not exist (¬G)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="axis-label">Belief (B)</td>
        <td class="matrix-cell">
            +∞<br>(infinite gain)
        </td>
        <td class="matrix-cell">
            −c<br>(finite loss)
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="axis-label">Disbelief (¬B)</td>
        <td class="matrix-cell">
            −∞<br>(infinite loss)
        </td>
        <td class="matrix-cell">
            +c<br>(finite gain)
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

Why? Because the stakes are incredibly high...or you might say *infinitely* high.

I realize it's lowest-common denominator apologetics and the criticism can be "hey, this is just fear-based religion," but I'd suggest this be more of a launching-off point for certain pragmatic types to activate their faith journeys; and less the idea that Christians should be constantly agitated (in dread) over their salvation, which is scrupulosity.

## Choose your hard

As an ["INTP" on the Myer's Briggs](/personality), I'll take the uncomfortable truth over the self-delusion every time, especially given the "expected value" from Pascal's Wager. But here's what I mean by 'choose your hard': Life is difficult either way. The question is which difficulty has purpose. The 'hard' of Christian belief means surrendering autonomy, accepting moral absolutes, and living with eternal stakes—all genuinely difficult in our culture.
But the 'hard' of disbelief means facing mortality with no ultimate meaning, living with the possibility of being wrong about infinite consequences, and finding purpose in what you ultimately believe is a meaningless universe.

But could you punt? As they say: no decision is itself a decision. And this was one of the most important points for Pascal: that the wager was a *necessary* decision, "impossible to avoid" for living person: "Yes; but you must wager. It is not optional. You are embarked."

It's funny: at first glance, free will seems like a beautiful gift from God to creation; but upon deeper consideration, it's the means by which we can lose everything; not because God is vindictive, but because of spiritual metaphysics: if we separate ourselves from or continuously choose against the Source of Life, there is necessarily only death[^3].

The fire and brimstone message may be unappealing and unnerving, but ulimately, I say if it wakes us from our slumber, bring it on—eternity is at stake.
