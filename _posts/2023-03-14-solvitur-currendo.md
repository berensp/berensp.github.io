The other day I'm loping down the exquisite [Historic Trail on Mount Sutro](/twin-peaks-mt-sutro/), and as I run past this particular point on the path, the podcast episode that I had listened to some *seven days prior* begins *re*-playing in my brain. Almost verbatim. And I realize the replay is perfectly synchronized with the loci I'm passing. (And I'll add that mine is by no means an exceptional memory.)

You may know — I did not — that the phenomenon whereby our brains tag memories to physical surroundings to facilitate their subsequent retrieval is known as *context-dependent memory,* and that the physiological mechanism underlying this phenomenon is thought to involve the hippocampus. Apparently, the hippocampus creates a kind of "neural map" of the environment, which helps to organize and store memories based on their location, activated again later via contextual cues (sights, sounds, smells) to retrieve the memory. The [method of loci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/method_of_loci) exploits this faculty where "memory athletes" can construct a "memory palace" that allows them to recall and recite, for example, an insane number of digits of pi.

But, of course, in my situation it was nothing so deliberate. The picturesque, eucalyptus-scented, birdsong-adorned urban trail through the woods was put to good work as a mnemonic by my brain without my realizing it.

Which is why I was amazed by how powerful the encoding can be (my near word-for-word recollection) while also flying below the radar as this unconscious process — unless interest or attention level is a factor (catalyst in the reaction).

Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, et al. were on to something with walking meetings *(solvitur ambulando)*: inhale some fresh air, boost your energy level, and maybe best of all, stimulate brain function. And on that last point, research that suggests that "moderately-intense" aerobic exercise increases the size of the anterior hippocampus and improves memory (or at least staves off hippocampal volume loss and memory deterioration)[^1], so I'm thinking: pick up the pace and amplify the effects. Ergo, *solvitur correndo* (it is solved by running)...*it* being the problem you're trying to work out; the memory you're trying to bring into focus; the n-th digit of pi you're trying to associate with a specific point on the trail.

Happy Pi Day,
