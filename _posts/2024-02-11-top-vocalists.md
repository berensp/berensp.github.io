I should be writing on something a bit more sophisticated or of greater social import, but a) it's been forever since I've put finger-to-keyboard with respect to this blog and b) we just saw [*The Greatest Night in Pop*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MD3oU1gowu4), which was a lot of fun, but got me thinking‚Äîwith all of those superstars coming together in one place on one night[^1]‚Äîabout that essential question I ruminate on from time to time (especially as a former college a cappella nerd), and that is: *who are the greatest rock 'n' roll vocalists of all time?* (Rock because this becomes infinitely harder as you broaden the scope into, say, R&B.)

[^1]: Actually, it's the part of *We are the World* when the sequence is Kenny Loggins to Steve Perry to Daryl Hall to Michael Jackson, and you think: wow, that's the varsity squad of mid-80s rock.

There are frontmen and frontwomen who have great style and showmanship but not necessarily top vocal prowess[^2], which is what I'm trying to get at. (In some cases isolated vocal tracks help tease this out.) Okay, the definitive list (which I reserve the right to readjust and edit on a whim):

[^2]: A good example of this, in my humble opinion, is Mick Jagger, undisputedly one of the greatest lead singers of all time, and even though he has an incredibly powerful voice with a distinctive sound, for my money he doesn't crack the top ten.

## Top Male Rock Vocalists
1. **Freddie Mercury** ‚Äì Decidedly #1 with his [full four-octave vocal range](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=KHYjIIJ14MI&feature=share). I guess more rock vocalists ought to be opera-trained.
2. **Robert Plant** ‚Äì a legend and [here are six isolated vocal tracks lend credence](https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/robert-plant-led-zeppelin-isolated-vocal-greatest-singer-ever/)
3. **Axl Rose** ‚Äì six-octave range, according to a 2014 article in the *Telegraph* in 2014, suggesting he "has a lower baritone than Barry White, and can reach higher notes than Tina Turner and Beyonc√©".
4. **Paul McCartney** ‚Äì It'd be sacrilege to not have a Beatle in Top 10, but I'll take Paul over John. [*Maybe I'm Amazed* (isolated vocals)](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=WeeNPLh2_qQ&feature=share).
5. **Daryl Hall** ‚Äì Can hang with the best of 'em. [*Out of Touch* (isolated vocals)](https://youtu.be/AeAkYS9WqrM)
6. **Prince** ‚Äì I hate to stir up [controversy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gazNwzC4H0) with this pick as this may reflect some Minnesota prejudice.
7. **Sting** ‚Äì [*Englishman In New York* (isolated vocals)](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=NnMlmREHTFQ&feature=share)
8. **Steve Perry** ‚Äì [*Open Arms* (isolated vocals)](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=OVTnzvJ4en4&si=TLLy4bKSSQBCvOoB)
9. **Bono Vox** ‚Äì [*With or Without You* (isolated vocals)](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=OWtVX2gbi4g&si=fdkBQ0X8UTXcbu1a).
10. **Van the Man** - incredibly versatility and power. [*Brown-eyed Girl* (isolated vocals)](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=pTcMgBsXHPc&si=vAOtAb-iL_A9ljI2).

*Honorable Mentions: Jeff Buckley, [Peter Cetera](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=auYCscvUVyo&feature=share), Kurt Cobain, Phil Collins, [Chris Cornell](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=TOqG_tCupeA&feature=share), Roger Daltrey, [Brad Delp (Boston)](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ_0_CWFk4c&feature=share), [John Fogerty](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=peggPraZfxk&feature=share), Elton John, Bobby Kimball (Toto), Mick Jagger, Jim Morrison, Steven Tyler, Eddie Vedder.*

## Top Female Rock Vocalists
1. **Ann Wilson** ‚Äì my unwavering #1...and like a fine wine, her voice just got better; exempli gratia: [live version of *Alone*](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ1ClKVZKxI&feature=share) or her live performance of [*Stairway to Heaven*](https://youtu.be/2cZ_EFAmj08)
2. **Janis Joplin** ‚Äì she brought the blues to rock 'n' roll. Inimitable.
3. **Tina Turner**
4. **Stevie Nicks**
5. **Grace Slick** (Jefferson Airplane)
6. **Bonnie Raitt** ‚Äì you may think she's too soft for "rock", and that may be so, but check this out: [*Can't Find My Way Home* (Live)](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=HGlRpJlsuCI&si=39nteAeFoCZTCTjH)
7. **Pat Benatar**
8. **Chrissie Hynde** (Pretenders)
9. **Gwen Stefani** ‚Äì again, we're in some gray areas with respect to genre as she moves among rock and pop and ska.
10. **Rachael Price** (Lake Street Dive) ‚Äì going to get one contemporary vocalist in this list

*Honorable Mentions: Brandi Carlisle, Joan Jett, Melissa Ethridge.*
