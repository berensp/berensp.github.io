I should be writing on something a bit more sophisticated or of greater import, but a) it's been forever since I've put finger-to-keyboard with respect to this blog and b) we just saw [*The Greatest Night in Pop*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MD3oU1gowu4), which was a lot of fun, but got me thinking‚Äîwith all of those superstars coming together in one place on one night‚Äîabout something I ruminate on from time to time (especially as a former college a cappella nerd), and that is: who *are* the greatest rock vocalists of all time? (Rock because this becomes infinitely harder as you broaden into, say, R&B.)

There are great frontmen and frontwomen who have great style and showmanship but not necessarily top vocal prowess[^1], which is what I'm trying to get at. (In some cases isolated vocal tracks help tease this out.) Okay, the definitive list (which I reserve the right to readjust and edit on a whim):

[^1]: A good example of this is Mick Jagger, whom is one of the greatest lead singers of all time, and even though he has an incredibly powerful voice with a distinctive sound, for my money he doesn't crack the top ten.

## Top Male Rock Vocalists
1. **Freddie Mercury** ‚Äì Decidedly #1 with his [full four-octave vocal range](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=KHYjIIJ14MI&feature=share). I guess more rock vocalists ought to be opera-trained.
2. **Robert Plant** ‚Äì [*Six isolated vocal tracks to prove Led Zeppelin‚Äôs Robert Plant is the greatest rock singer ever*](https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/robert-plant-led-zeppelin-isolated-vocal-greatest-singer-ever/)
3. **Axl Rose** ‚Äì six-octave range, according to a 2014 article in the *Telegraph* in 2014, suggesting he "has a lower baritone than Barry White, and can reach higher notes than Tina Turner and Beyonc√©".
4. **Paul McCartney** ‚Äì It'd be sacrilege to not have a Beatle in Top 10, but I'll take Paul over John. [*Maybe I'm Amazed* - Vocal Isolated](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=WeeNPLh2_qQ&feature=share).
5. **Daryl Hall** ‚Äì Can hang with the best of 'em. [*Out of Touch* (Isolated Vocal)](https://youtu.be/AeAkYS9WqrM)
6. **Prince** ‚Äì I hate to stir up [controversy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gazNwzC4H0) with this pick, but I had to have a Minnesotan on this list.
7. **Sting** ‚Äì [*Englishman In New York (Isolated Vocal, Bass & Piano)*](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=NnMlmREHTFQ&feature=share)
8. **Steve Perry** ‚Äì [*Open Arms* (Isolated Vocals)](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=OVTnzvJ4en4&si=TLLy4bKSSQBCvOoB)
9. **Bono** ‚Äì I love how he couldn't really sing when U2 started out, but he honed his voice over time into a fine instrument.
10. **Van the Man** - incredibly versatile https://www.melophobemusic.com/post/top-100-greatest-rock-vocalists-of-all-time#google_vignette

Honorable Mentions: Jeff Buckley, [Peter Cetera](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=auYCscvUVyo&feature=share), Kurt Cobain, Phil Collins, [Chris Cornell](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=TOqG_tCupeA&feature=share), Roger Daltrey, [Brad Delp (Boston)](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ_0_CWFk4c&feature=share), [John Fogerty](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=peggPraZfxk&feature=share), Elton John, Bobby Kimball (Toto), Mick Jagger, Jim Morrison, Steven Tyler, Eddie Vedder.

## Top Female Rock Vocalists
1. **Ann Wilson** - my #1...and like a fine wine, her voice just got better: just check this [live version of *Alone*](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ1ClKVZKxI&feature=share) or her live performance of [*Stairway to Heaven*](https://youtu.be/2cZ_EFAmj08)
2. **Janis Joplin** ‚Äì she brought the blues to rock 'n' roll. Inimitable.
3. **Tina Turner**
4. **Stevie Nicks**
5. **Grace Slick** (Jefferson Airplane)
6. **Bonnie Raitt** ‚Äì you may think she's too soft for "rock", and that may be so, but check this out: [*Can't Find My Way Home* (Live)](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=HGlRpJlsuCI&si=39nteAeFoCZTCTjH)
7. **Pat Benatar
8. **Chrissie Hynde** (Pretenders)
9. **Gwen Stefani** ‚Äì again, we're in some gray areas with respect to genre as she moves among rock and pop and ska.
10. **Rachael Price** (Lake Street Dive) ‚Äì going to get one contemporary vocalist in this list

Honorable Mentions: Brandi Carlisle, Joan Jett, Melissa Ethridge.
