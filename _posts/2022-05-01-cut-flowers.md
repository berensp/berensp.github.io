As someone working in and around data analytics, *I'm often told* that evaluating the effects of explanatory variables on a response variable is the name of the game. But sometimes there's a delayed reaction (response lag) and for some time you don't see the effect you'd expect to see.

Enter the **Cut Flowers Theory**, a useful little mental model / framework I've been thinking about recently that seemingly pops up everywhere and conveniently works in different contexts. 

In a nutshell: freshly cut flowers at first look just as beautiful and smell just as fragrant as when they were planted in soil, but of course they're in fact beginning to wither and die once they're in a vase, stem severed from roots. So, too, with certain phenomena that are dependent upon and sustained by other external and often invisible forces or beings: in the short-term you don't notice any withering (degradation in quality), but in the long-term you do.

Where do we see it in real life? A few examples:

## 1) Remote work &#127968;

Last week Brian Chesky announced Airbnb's plans to go to a fully-remote work model.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today, we’re announcing that Airbnb employees can live and work anywhere. <br><br>Our design for working at Airbnb has 5 key features:</p>&mdash; Brian Chesky (@bchesky) <a href="https://twitter.com/bchesky/status/1519831566486147073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Say what you will about it, but the physical office environment creates myriad opportunities and serendipities for relationships to *bloom* and *grow* organically, and we're starting to learn about the costs and drawbacks of a Zoom-only approach[^1]. So for whom will a Zoom + Slack + quarterly meet-up model be enough to *maintain* culture? Presumably established, successful companies like Airbnb that can exploit a dynamic existing culture with an existing web of relationships...at least for a certain period of time. The question is how long?

And that's for companies that built culture the old *analog* way. What will be interesting is to see if companies built *remote from the get-go* can successfully build good culture. My guess is that the most elite start-ups with the most talented, motivated, digitally-disposed (Gen Z+) employees can do it, but many other companies won't be able to swing it so easily. Time will tell.

## 2) Long-term investments &#128184;

There are several corporate spend categories where the effects of a cutback don't show up so clearly in the short-term—or at least are hard to quantify—but the negative effects do manifest in the long-term:
- **Brand value** is a (delayed) outcome variable of all kinds of decisions (positive or negative). For example: a company or business unit under pressure to deliver quarterly or annual numbers optimizes for the short-term and to do so pulls a lever that cheapens the brand (e.g. deep discounting). They may realize the short-term lift and even see no negative brand impact for quite some time: sweet!...rinse and repeat?! Don't be naive: eventually you'll have to pay the piper.
- **Innovation** ([successful] new product introductions or other innovation-related metric) suffers when R&D investment is pared back...again, perhaps not immediately, depending on the pipeline, but in the longer-term.
- **Employee Attrition** (or other people metric), influenced by countless direct and indirect "human capital" investments.
- (We could keep going...probably with more examples than exclusions...)

## 3) Country/Social Health &#127963;

- **Because the Constitution, Man!**. We're often wondering why the public square is so cacophonous and polarizing? Why the shouting and polemics and absence of reasonable arguments? I won't pretend to have a complete answer as there's plenty of good expert thinking on this topic, but I submit that at least in part it's that we're not operating from the same moral framework. We see a great many Twitter debates reach a "because the Constitution says so" roadblock and get stuck. If one can't go past the Constitution to it's modern philosophy and natural law (first) principles, one is de facto constrained to Jefferson's words, and then it's a difficult game of interpretation and trying to apply to novel situations.

- **Fides et Ratio. We find people have been disaffiliating from churches and religions for quite some time, which you may think should be of no consquenece other than their own spirital well-being and state of grace. But then we try to discuss the relative morality of this thing or that, and there's no shared language, and so it devolves to *de gustibus non est disputandum*. Alexis de Tocqueville maintained that faith underpins society: "Liberty cannot be established without morality, nor morality without faith." David Perell's recent *[The Book You Need to Read](https://perell.com/essay/the-book-you-need-to-read/)* argued for reading the Bible not because you are or aren't Christian but because of its influence on the culture. Faith without reason leads to superstition, but reason without faith leads to nihilism and relativism, which then, Bishop Barron is wont to argue, leads to voluntarism (a contest of wills) (i.e. if we can't have a reasoned argument then perhaps I'll be left with no other choice but violence).
