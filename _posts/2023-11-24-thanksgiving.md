*Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.* (—Philippians 4:6)

Thanksgiving gatherings during my childhood years were large gatherings (never fewer than a couple dozen) with all the traditional victuals (that could compete with the best Thanksgiving tables across the country), but were most memorable for the postprandial period when people set down their dessert forks, the music was turned off, and we'd go around the table and offer up a word of thanks. And by word I mean many words, because
1. this is the Irish side of the family, and provide these folks a platform and out come the memories and wistful stories and political musings and jokes and so on; and
2. every person two years and up was ~~pressured~~ invited to "gave thanks" and so this sharing of what you were thankful for would take the better part of an hour.

(Lisa survived this tradition early in our courtship, and immediately afterward I got a light scolding for not forewarning her that there'd be public speaking involved in coming to the Berens Family Thanksgiving.)

She's since come to appreciate and love it, and we've carried on the tradition now in our home, because we think it important to pause and reflect, and when you utter these thanks aloud to a group they seem to ascend from nice sentiments to actual prayers.

And sure, you always hear gratitude for *family, friends, health, and jobby job—please pass the gravy,* but if the environment is relatively "safe"[^1], some people will share something from below the surface. In fact it happened this year that someone in our party discussed his thankfulness for certain recent struggles in his life, which reminded me of C. S. Lewis' aphorism: "We ought to give thanks for all fortune: if it is 'good,' because it is good; if 'bad' because it works in us patience, humility, and hope." Easier said than done, of course, but I certainly aspire to live that way: where all is gift in one way or another…or in the words of Flannery O'Connor who was brilliant and so wise on this stuff: "I can, with one eye squinted, take it all as a blessing."

As for my part, I ain't got much reason to complain—quite the opposite, in fact—and so in the near-term I'll employ [John Prine's words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNDmIrh1Cwo)[^2] as my thanksgiving:

[^2]: Thanks for the introduction, Uncle John.

> Today I walked down the street I use to wander
Yeah, shook my head and made myself a bet
There was all these things that I don't think I remember
Hey, how lucky can one man get.
Hey, how lucky can one man get.
Hey, how lucky can
One...
Man...
Get.

Happy Thanksgiving,
