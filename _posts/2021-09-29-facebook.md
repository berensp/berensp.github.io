Too many people have already abandoned Facebook for me to be awarded any trendsetter points, but when I asked myself why I was still on‚Äî[rather, when Van did](https://youtu.be/pPn2zH_8OmY)‚ÄîI had trouble coming up with good reasons. And now the emergence of the [Facebook Files](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039) this week sort of breaks the camel's back.

## Why I joined Facebook (back in '07)
- Because Friendster had peaked and was waning
- I was enough years out of school where reconnecting with old friends (a.k.a. wall posts and "pokes") was a novelty and so rewarding: a superpower making possible a look into the personal details of someone's life without actually engaging them in conversation. Whereas you used to need to "catch up" with someone to find out they had a job change, moved to a new apartment, or started a new relationship; it was offered up to you at no cost.[^1]
- I did appreciate the value of *pull* communications (vs. *push*). Maybe we all did, because if you remember the world pre-Facebook: you'd inadvertently end up on one of these group email distlists where either the content or the frequency (or both) maybe wasn't exactly to your liking (e.g. your neighbor's joke of the day email)? How to opt out gracefully (üò¨)? It was tricky. Facebook delivered that *pull* ability and means to regain agency (i.e. I can read or not read that joke, and the posting party doesn't need to know).

[^1]: I remember my friend Meera observing the strangeness of this after a college reunion, noting how bizarre it was that everyone was up to date on everyone else's news and all the gossip‚Äîof acquaintances, mind you; not close buds‚Äî*before* the reunion had even begun. (It's hard to remember how odd this was at the time...before it was normalized.)

## Why I stayed
- The platform continuously improved (wall postings expanded to photos and videos and messages) ‚Üí more memories captured ‚Üí more family/friends jumped on ‚Üí more likes ‚Üí more stickiness/value/FOMO
- Case in point: growing up you were never deluged with birthday wishes‚Äîit was just your family and few close friends who would know your birthday‚Äîbut then with your special day being promulgated to 100s of FB friends: wow, the love (dopamine hits)!

## Why leave?

### Just the typical litany
- Disinformation masquerading as news
- Echo chamber / polarization
- Conspiracy mongering
- Toxicity for teen girls[^2]
- Overall well-being [^3]
- Being productized
- Social validation
- Outrage reward[^4]
- Distraction
- It generally "ripping apart the social fabric of how society works" via "dopamine-driven feedback loops"[^5]

### I guess I don't really have 1,284 friends

I genuinely like people a lot...and like a lot of people. The institutions and communities I've been fortunate to be a part of have surrounded me with endlessly wonderful and lovely humans. And as much as I hope to get to know everyone on the deepest level in the next life, I'm afraid I subscribe to the concept of [Dunbar's Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number) (i.e. we're capable of managing relationships‚Äîstaying in contact at least once per year and knowing how friends relate to others‚Äîwith roughly 150 people). It's a sad reality when you acknolwedge that there are so many fabulous people out there. But it suggests the need for intentionality with friendships and relationships; the opposite of what we did for years with Facebook "friending".

[^2]: Makes body image issues worse in one in three teen girls when they perceive everyone else to be "living their best lives". As a fella with young nieces and a daughter on the way, no me gusta. *[Facebook Knows Instagram Is Toxic for Teen Girls, Company Documents Show](https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739)*

## Not intending to become a hermit

Nor do I want to discourage contact/interaction. Just want to do it on my own terms; not those of Facebook, Inc.

I've already been running my own personal experiment to see if I can abstain from Facebook/Instagram for my own personal wellness. I've been able to check only occasionally and deleted the apps from my phone, so I think I'm good with the discipline; but having active profiles gives the impression one's still available but just (annoyingly) unresponsive to posts, messenger pings, etc. So it's time to throw the steering wheel out the window and commit to other media.

### Still reachable by pigeon post

So please do still be in touch; and here's how:
- **Events:** send me an email or a calendar item to my email. (If we have to use Evite...maybe I'll just come back to Facebook.)
- **Analog:** doorbell (between 07:00 and 22:00), snail mail, running into each other serendipitously on the street
- **Photos:** [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com), [Box](https://box.com), etc.
- **Messaging:** <a href="mailto:pb@omg.lol">good ol' fashioned electronic mail</a>, [Signal](https://signal.org), [Telegram](https://t.me/berensp), KakaoTalk, [Keybase](https://keybase.io/berens), [Twitter DM](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=19028711)
- **Social media üòÅ:** [Twitter](https://twitter.com/berensp)[^6], [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@berens)[^7], [RSS](https://berens.co/feed.xml)[^8]
- **Professional stuff:** [AngelList](https://angel.co/berens), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/berensp/)

[^6]: I still have Twitter, which is maybe hypocritical, though I'd argue it's less toxic and has greater utility. (But who knows, maybe I'll take [Balaji Srinivasan's advice and eventually exit Twitter, too](https://balajis.com/how-to-gradually-exit-twitter/).)

[^7]: [Mastodon and the fediverse](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/technology/social-media-privacy.html) should be the answer to social media's ills, but we all know there's a network externalities hurdle to overcome.

[^8]: As newsletters/blogs are becoming more prevalent maybe this old-school, user-controlled technology is the answer (and then antidote to the monolithic social media-controlled feeds). I'm trying to migrate my content to it (via [Feedly](https://feedly.com)).

### Updating the rolodex üìá

Another sticky aspect of Facebook is its fine ability to serve as a mega-rolodex. I've got a pretty good one going in Google Contacts; it just requires me to obtain and stay up-to-date on your info, s'il vous pla√Æt:
- email address
- mobile phone
- postal address
- your website, etc.
- birthday, anniversary

Anyway, that's all. Hopefully this doesn't come across as a supercilious; I'm just trying to explain my why and how of disconnecting in case others are looking for an off-ramp.

Adieu, Friends IRL üëã! I have too grieved a heart to take a tedious leave.
