Labor Day is one of those holidays where if you stopped the average person on the street, they might struggle to explain its meaning. To refresh: it originated from the fight for the eight-hour workday and better working conditions in the late 19th century. Over time, it evolved into a broader celebration of workers' contributions to American prosperity. Which makes today a little ironic and/or outdated when labor seems increasingly disconnected from the wealth it creates. Stock valuations soar while wages stagnate and unemployment rises; a pattern that would have seemed impossible when we assumed prosperity flowed to both labor and capital.

The empirical foundation of labor-capital disconnection is the "Great Decoupling"[^1] which describes the post-1970s divergence between productivity, GDP growth, and median wages; but you know it better as the [wtfhappenedin1971.com](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/) meme. For example:

## Wherefore this disconnection?

Plenty of factors influence the capital markets and valuations, but some of the reasons labor plays a diminishing role:
1. **Technological leverage** – extreme scalability; "winner-take-all" markets
2. **Network effects** – digital platforms extract value and create monopolistic dynamics (dominate entire sectors and with relatively small workforces), concentrating wealth among capital owners and a small number of highly skilled workers[^2].
	- And/or allowing said companies the surplus to create "b.s. jobs" (h/t David Graeber) (e.g., Twitter being able to let go three-quarters of its workforce and not feel an effect…although I'd also say that long-term hindsight may see the [cut flowers effect](/cut-flowers.html) here)
3. **Financialization / financial engineering** – e.g., stock buybacks, LBOs, other fancy financial instruments that boost share prices without necessarily improving real economic output.
4. **Global supply chains** arbitrage labor costs

## AI and the path forward

It's still early innings, but with AI we aren't just seeing yet another shock to the labor markets; it potentially spells the most significant acceleration of labor-capital disconnection in history, targeting knowledge work across sectors. In the absence of a major course correction we should expect wealth polarity to continue to increase in this post-labor-capital disconnection era when AI separates those who can marshal the tools and benefits of AI from the have-nots (the 'hollowing out' hypothesis[^3]). Of course, inequality is no new phenomenon; it's a feature of a capitalism[^4]; but AI may be an accelerant for capital owners (which in AI is even more concentrated than previous technologies) and high-skill workers[^5].

[^3]: Middle-skill jobs disappear while low-skill service jobs and high-skill knowledge work remain, creating labor market polarization. David H. Autor, Lawrence F. Katz, and Melissa S. Kearney, "The Polarization of the U.S. Labor Market," *American Economic Review* 96, no. 2 (May 2006): 189-194.

[^4]: Piketty's r > g formula: when the return to capital (r) exceeds economic growth (g), wealth concentrates among capital owners regardless of labor productivity. Thomas Piketty, *Capital in the Twenty-First Century*, trans. Arthur Goldhammer (Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2014).

[^5]: There's a labor economics theory called "skill-biased technological change" (SBTC) that explains how technology complements high-skill workers while substituting for others, creating winner-take-all dynamics that benefit capital and a small labor elite.

What are we going to do about it? Some kind of restructuring of ownership / wealth redistribution (e.g., UBI, sovereign wealth funds)? Elite capture suggests probably not. Hopefully, we will at least reinvest in society by reimagining our education system, though individual skill upgrading may not solve what is fundamentally a structural problem of capital concentration.

Of course, there will be shifts in labor toward AI resistant markets (e.g., plumbing, therapy, interior design, childcare), and others won't see huge labor displacement—at least in the near-term—but while celebrating the worker today, we need to think about whether 'remaining relevant' is the right framing when the underlying relationship between work and prosperity is being restructured.

Happy Labor Day,
