Labor Day is one of those holidays where if you stopped the average person on the street, they might struggle to explain its meaning. To refresh: it originated from the fight for the eight-hour workday and better working conditions in the late 19th century. Over time, it evolved into a broader celebration of workers' contributions to American prosperity. Which makes today a little ironic and/or outdated when labor seems increasingly disconnected from the wealth it creates. Stock valuations soar while wages stagnate and unemployment rises; a pattern that would have seemed impossible when we assumed prosperity flowed to both labor and capital.

The empirical foundation of labor-capital disconnection is the "Great Decoupling"[^1] which describes the post-1970s divergence between productivity, GDP growth, and median wages; but you know it better as the [wtfhappenedin1971.com](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/) meme. For example:

## Wherefore this disconnection?

Plenty of factors influence the capital markets and valuations, but some of the reasons labor plays a diminishing role:
1. **Technological leverage** – extreme scalability; "winner-take-all" markets
2. **Network effects** – digital platforms extract value and create monopolistic dynamics (dominate entire sectors and with relatively small workforces), concentrating wealth among capital owners and a small number of highly skilled workers[^2].
	- And/or allowing said companies the surplus to create "b.s. jobs" (h/t David Graeber) (e.g., Twitter being able to let go three-quarters of its workforce and not feel an effect…although I'd also say that long-term hindsight may see the [cut flowers effect](/cut-flowers.html) here)
3. **Financialization / financial engineering** – e.g., stock buybacks, LBOs, other fancy financial instruments that boost share prices without necessarily improving real economic output.
4. **Global supply chains** arbitrage labor costs

## AI: The looming accelerant

It's still early innings, but AI has the potential to spell the most significant acceleration of labor-capital disconnection in history once adoption reaches scale. Recent empirical evidence suggests current job displacement effects remain modest[^3], but the structural conditions are being set for dramatic future impact. As AI adoption accelerates beyond the current 9% of businesses using it in production, we should expect wealth polarity to increase dramatically when AI separates those who can marshal the tools and benefits of AI from the have-nots (the 'hollowing out' hypothesis[^4]). Of course, inequality is no new phenomenon; it's a feature of a capitalism[^5]; but AI may be an accelerant for capital owners (which in AI is even more concentrated than previous technologies) and high-skill workers[^6].

Thomas Piketty, *Capital in the Twenty-First Century*, trans. Arthur Goldhammer (Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2014).

[^6]: There's a labor economics theory called "skill-biased technological change" (SBTC) that explains how technology complements high-skill workers while substituting for others, creating winner-take-all dynamics that benefit capital and a small labor elite.

What are we going to do about it? Some kind of restructuring of ownership / wealth redistribution (e.g., UBI, sovereign wealth funds)? Elite capture suggests probably not. Hopefully, we will at least reinvest in society by reimagining our education system, though this assumes the problem is skills mismatch rather than systemic capital concentration.

Of course, there will be shifts in labor toward AI resistant markets (e.g., plumbing, therapy, interior design, childcare), and current data suggests most workers aren't yet seeing displacement—but while celebrating the worker today, we need to think about whether individual adaptation can address what may become a fundamental shift in how value gets created and distributed as AI adoption scales.

Happy Labor Day,
