Happy Labor Day. This is one of those holidays where if you did “Jaywalking” (interviewing the Average Joe) on the street) you might find a relatively low percentage of the populace being able to correctly identify the meaning of the day. Myself included. It originated from the fight for the eight-hour workday and better working conditions in the late 19th century, but also celebrates workers’ role in building American prosperity (i.e., in building America into what she is economically).

But something I’ve been noticing and thinking about as of late is the disconnection between labor and capital. Like it’s interesting how we’ll go through periods where stock valuations are soaring and wages are stagnating (and/or unemployment is high), when these used to move together; or at least we’d talk and act like they did.

You might know the [[wtfhappenedin1971.com](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/)](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/) meme(s)? Well, some of these graphs show the disconnection between wages and GDP per capita, for example, and it happens to be in the early 70s.

Wherefore this disconnection?

1. technology creating leverage
2. Financialization and financial engineering (stock buybacks, LBOs, other fancy financial instruments that boost share prices without necessarily improving real economic output).
3. Network effects in digital platforms creating monopolistic dynamics where a few companies can dominate entire sectors with relatively small workforces, concentrating wealth among capital owners and a small number of highly skilled workers. (And/or allowing said companies the surplus to create "b.s. jobs" [h/t David Graeber] [e.g., Twitter being able to let go three-quarters of its workforce and not feel an effect…although I’d also say that longterm hindsight may see the cut flowers effect here) 
4. Global supply chains (arbitrage labor costs worldwide).
Regarding "bullshit jobs" (David Graeber's term) - the Twitter case does suggest some corporate employment may be more about organizational inertia than productive necessity. However, the long-term impacts of such dramatic workforce reductions remain to be seen.
The stock market's performance during periods of high unemployment reflects this capital-labor disconnect, as markets increasingly price in technological leverage, market power, and financial engineering rather than traditional labor-intensive value creation.

And that’s before AI… With AI we’ll see another shock to the labor markets, maybe not with layoffs *per se* but with retooling/reskilling.

It’s also hard to not think that wealth polarity wouldn’t continue to increase in the post-labor-capital disconnection era.

What are we going to do about it? UBI? Hopefully reinvest in society by reimaging our education system in the post-AI age.
