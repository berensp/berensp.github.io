Happy Labor Day. This is one of those holidays where if you did ‚ÄúJaywalking‚Äù (interviewing the Average Joe) on the street) you might find a relatively low percentage of the populace being able to correctly identify the meaning of the day. Myself included. It originated from the fight for the eight-hour workday and better working conditions in the late 19th century, but also celebrates workers‚Äô role in building American prosperity (i.e., in building America into what she is economically).

But something I‚Äôve been noticing and thinking about as of late is the disconnection between labor and capital. Like it‚Äôs interesting how we‚Äôll go through periods where stock valuations are soaring and wages are stagnating (and/or unemployment is high), when these used to move together; or at least we‚Äôd talk and act like they did.

You might know the [wtfhappenedin1971.com](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/) meme(s)? Well, some of these graphs show the disconnection between wages and GDP per capita, for example, and it happens to be in the early 70s.

## Wherefore this disconnection?

Plenty of factors influence the capital markets and valuations, but labor plays a diminishing role due to:
1. **Technological leverage** ‚Äì extreme scalability; "winner-take-all" markets
2. **Financialization / financial engineering** ‚Äì e.g., stock buybacks, LBOs, other fancy financial instruments that boost share prices without necessarily improving real economic output.
3. **Network effects** ‚Äì digital platforms creating monopolistic dynamics (dominate entire sectors and with relatively small workforces), concentrating wealth among capital owners and a small number of highly skilled workers.
	- And/or allowing said companies the surplus to create "b.s. jobs" (h/t David Graeber) (e.g., Twitter being able to let go three-quarters of its workforce and not feel an effect‚Ä¶although I'd also say that long-term hindsight may see the [cut flowers effect](/cut-flowers.html) here)
4. **Global supply chains arbitrage labor costs**

## Obligatory AI section ü§ñ

Srsly, though. With AI we'll see‚Äîwe are seeing‚Äîanother shock to the labor markets, maybe not with layoffs *per se* but with retooling/reskilling. It's also hard to not think that wealth polarity wouldn't continue to increase in the post-labor-capital disconnection era.

What are we going to do about it? Some kind of restructuring of ownership / wealth redistribution (e.g., UBI, sovereign wealth funds)?

Hopefully, we will at least reinvest in society by reimaging our education system in the post-AI age. And then, presumably, the markets will naturally shift where it assigns value to areas that are AI resistant (e.g., plumbing, therapy, interior design, childcare,
