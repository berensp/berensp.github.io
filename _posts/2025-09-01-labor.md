Labor Day is one of those holidays where if you did stopped and interviewed the Average Joe on the street you might not expect him to correctly identify the meaning of the day. To refresh our memories: it originated from the fight for the eight-hour workday and better working conditions in the late 19th century, but also celebrates workers' role in building American prosperity (i.e., in building America into what she is economically).

But something I've been noticing and thinking about as of late is the disconnection between labor and capital. It's interesting how we'll go through periods where stock valuations are soaring and wages are stagnating (and/or unemployment is high), when these used to move together; or at least we'd talk and act like they did.

The empirical foundation of labor-capital disconnection is the "Great Decoupling"[^1] which describes the post-1970s divergence between productivity, GDP growth, and median wages; but you know it better as the [wtfhappenedin1971.com](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/) meme(s), for example:

## Wherefore this disconnection?

Plenty of factors influence the capital markets and valuations, but labor plays a diminishing role due to:
1. **Technological leverage** ‚Äì extreme scalability; "winner-take-all" markets
2. **Financialization / financial engineering** ‚Äì e.g., stock buybacks, LBOs, other fancy financial instruments that boost share prices without necessarily improving real economic output.
3. **Network effects** ‚Äì digital platforms extract value and create monopolistic dynamics (dominate entire sectors and with relatively small workforces), concentrating wealth among capital owners and a small number of highly skilled workers. (A.k.a. Platform capitalism theory [Srnicek].)
	- And/or allowing said companies the surplus to create "b.s. jobs" (h/t David Graeber) (e.g., Twitter being able to let go three-quarters of its workforce and not feel an effect‚Ä¶although I'd also say that long-term hindsight may see the [cut flowers effect](/cut-flowers.html) here)
4. **Global supply chains** arbitrage labor costs

## Obligatory AI section ü§ñ

Srsly, though. With AI we'll see‚Äîwe are seeing‚Äîanother shock to the labor markets, not always with layoffs or hiring freezes/reductions *per se* but with retooling/reskilling. It's also hard to not think that wealth polarity wouldn't continue to increase in the post-labor-capital disconnection era when AI separates the haves (those who can marshal the tools and benefits of AI) and have nots (the 'hollowing out' hypothesis[^2]). Inequality isn't a new phenomenon; it's a feature of a capitalism, as Thomas Piketty[^3] et al. argue; but AI may be an accelerant.

[^3]: Piketty's r > g formula: when the return to capital (r) exceeds economic growth (g), wealth concentrates among capital owners regardless of labor productivity.

What are we going to do about it? Some kind of restructuring of ownership / wealth redistribution (e.g., UBI, sovereign wealth funds)?

Hopefully, we will at least reinvest in society by reimaging our education system in the post-AI age. And then, presumably, the markets will naturally shift where it assigns value to areas that are AI resistant (e.g., plumbing, therapy, interior design, childcare).

Happy Labor Day,
