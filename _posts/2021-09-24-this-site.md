- **H/T to [@dwr](https://twitter.com/dwr)**. I got this set up after stumbling upon his [Clio Jekyll template](https://github.com/danromero/clio) and [post on the why and how of using GitHub Pages and Jekyll](https://danromero.org/how-this-website-works.html).
- **So how *does* this site work?** Basically, instead of getting fancy-pants with WordPress, PHP, and other server-side languages; you simply [host your website with GitHub Pages](https://medium.com/8px-magazine/hosting-a-website-for-free-get-started-with-google-domains-github-pages-980986550958). Then Jekyll ("a static site generator") combines templates with content that you write in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), and spews forth perfect, ready-to-upload little files ‚ú®.
- **Free, Flexible, Future-proof.** Platforms like Medium, Quora, Revue may eventually shut down or hold you hostage to fees; whereas this solution is the happy opposite...because ["plain text is forever"](https://twitter.com/zeldman/status/667846154114105344).
- **Take it for a spin.** If you're so inclined [here's a good place to start](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll).
