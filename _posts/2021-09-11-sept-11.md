Twenty years ago September 11th changed from an unremarkable day to something with as much connotation for Americans as the Fourth of July.

## Where were you on September 11, 2001?

It's indeed our generation's equivalent of what was for Boomers: "where were you when Kennedy was assassinated?" (i.e. the memory is easily conjured at the question).

I was in Anaheim, California on a consulting engagement, having taken [American Airlines Flight 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_11) to get to Los Angeles from Boston just 48 hours prior to its dreadful successor. Whereas New Yorkers and others in the eastern US lived through the horror in real time, so much had already happened by the time we had awoken on the west coast that it was jolting and dizzying to take in so much at once. What's less memorable (because of the daze we were in) is how work and life ground to a halt that week and one day blurred into the next as we followed the 'round-the-clock news cycle to assess the remaining danger and to find answers that wouldn't come.

Like a lot of stranded travelers it took forever for me to make back it home, and when I did it was via short hops: LAX to St. Louis to Newark to Providence (and then train the last 50 miles to Boston) — but it was that last flight leg from EWR to PVD where I got the aerial view of the terrible smoldering destruction in Lower Manhattan.

After the chaos came the grieving. Then the patriotism. Not from the Right, but from everyone. Remember the American flags flying and being sported everywhere (on the sides of buildings, on lawn signs, on lapels)—a stark difference from today where (sadly) you can make an educated guess about political leanings when you see an American flag emoji in a Twitter bio. And not just patriotism, but an outpouring of love and support from abroad. And a celebration of true heroes, living out John 15:13; like Welles Crowther[^1].

But then came retribution (The War on Terror) that unfortunately squandered the "hope, goodwill, and unity that 9/11 initially created"[^2].

## My personal connotation of September 11th

My lovely wife/yeobo was born on September 11th, 19alskdfjahem, and so since our courtship that's happily replaced the gloom 9/11 otherwise carries.

And then a few years ago our little boy decided he'd make his grand debut *on the very same day*. He was born 10:35 PDT, but a few minutes later [Lisa's OB](https://doctors.adventisthealth.org/provider/Frederica+S+Lofquist/1343074) whisked her away to the OR to stop a massive postpartum hemorrhage made out-of-control by disseminated intravascular coagulation ([DIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disseminated_intravascular_coagulation)). If it weren't for Dr. Lofquist's quick decision-making (including summoning her longtime interventional radiology specialist buddy Dr. Myron Marx) Lisa's life could've been in grave danger. At the very least, without Marx et al., it would've been hard to avoid a hysterectomy and ergo we wouldn't be preparing to welcome another new baby into our family.

So September 11th to me means the blessed day both my wife and son were born, the day my wife' life was saved, and the day that enabled the possibility of our second child to be conceived. Deo gratias.
