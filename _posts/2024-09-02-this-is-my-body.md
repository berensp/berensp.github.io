I had the basics from Bishop Barron's *Word on Fire* podcasts and lectures (e.g., how Christ is speaking very literally in John 6 and doubles down with his language *[trogo]*), but this was a great deeper dive into some territory I hadn't been exposed to:
- Council of Trent holding that "Christ becomes present in the Eucharistic elements *ex vi verborum* (by the power of the words)" (p.106)
- St. Irenaeus' refutation of Gnosticism in *Against Heresies* (p.79):
	> How can they say that the bread over which thanks has been given is the Lord's Body and the cup His Blood, when they will not admit that same Lord is the Son of the world's Creator, that is, His Word, through whom trees bear fruit...and 'the earth gives first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear' (Mark 4:28)?
- The theory of 11th century theologian Berengarius of Tours, and the debate that arose from it.
