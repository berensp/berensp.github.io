Like so many others I do love the yuletide season; the happy, hygge feelings and experiences of my youth playing no small part, I’m sure. I was recently delving into the amazing power of the hippocampus and its ability to construct and preserve narrative memories—and the amygdala to encode the emotion—and so for childhood memories as indelible as those of Christmas, the associations surely span the senses: the visual (lights and decorations), the olfactory (the wonderful smells emanating from the kitchen), and perhaps most powerfully for me: the auditory (the Christmas songs of olde)[^1].

[^1]:Apparently when memories of multisensory (i.e. various sensory experiences being intertwined) there may be better encoding, facilitating memory recall and enhancing the clarity of the memories. 

But the paramount reason I attach great meaning to Christmas music is because every since I can remember, the centerpiece of my family's Christmastide was a large, multigenerational caroling party the week before Christmas, featuring Mom at the piano. She’s a very fine pianist in her own right, but where she really excels is in getting people singing (even the non-singer types) by keeping it lively, transposing to the key that would work for the majority of male and female voices, knowing when to move to the next selection(even if there were verses remaining in the current selection), etc.—this is essentially nunchi (눈치) from a musical point of view (a musical emotional quotient?). Anyway, everyone so looked forward to and came to rely upon this event as an indispensable part of their Christmas: joining voices with friends and neighbors and letting these timeless hymns wash over you again: the in innocence of *Deck the Halls*, the childlike joy of *Jingle Bells*, the solemnity of *Silent Night*.

Ergo the primacy of Christmas music in my Christmas, and so here’s a little Christmas gift: some my favorite Christmas tracks, curated into a few playlists, though it's on (exasperated sigh) YouTube music. It actually began as a single master list a number of years ago, which I’ve both expanded and pruned gradually, but just this year I split them by genre because I was finding it jarring to jump among wildly different genres (e.g., going directly from Felix Mendelssohn’s *Es wird ein Stern aus Jakob aufgehn* into Whitney Houston’s *Do You Hear What I Hear*).

I’m no ethnomusicologist so forgive me if I’ve miscategorized any tunes. Tom Nichols gave his favorite Christmas hits a year ago and also organized his thinking by genre[^2], although he had a “religious carols” category. I didn’t split the religious from the secular, although some genres by nature may loosely correspond with a certain religiosity or lack thereof (e.g., the indie rock maybe won’t cover the Latin hymns; and concomitantly, the Renaissance polyphonic stuff won’t deal with *Frosty the Snowman*).

Without further ado: my Christmas essentials in five YouTube Music playlists:
- [🎻 Classical / Classical Choral](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_64Fz1c-ODKsArG3LplJi_GqAnF5tLJh) – there’s a lot of exuberance that accompanies the Christmas season, but Advent demands some reflection and contemplation. It’s hard to match the exquisite beauty of something like *O Magnum Mysterium*. And I do love *La Peregrinación* (both the King’s Singers’ version as well as that of Mercedes Sosa).
- [🎸 Indie/Folk/Rock/Pop](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_64Fz1c-ODLKYRJ8wVBL0AGFX0TsdzQo) – what the cool kids listen to—or what formerly cool kids listened to? I do especially love the melancholic **********************Green Grows the Holly********************** by Calexico and Springsteen’s *******************************Santa Claus Is Comin’ to Town******************************* is a modern classic.
- [🎷 Jazz](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_64Fz1c-ODJVh7ikkZ-NMbiFPKGwZK0M) – can you get more quintessentially American as far as genres go? I love the Vince Guaraldi Trio’s A Charlie Brown Christmas, and Harry Connick’s swingin’ Winter Wonderland (from When Harry Met Sally) is Lisa’s absolute favourite.
- [🎹 Traditional/Oldies](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_64Fz1c-ODKOXnA_3WqyULSXcBY_WMOb) – bring on the nostalgia with Andy Williams, Bing Crosby, Ol' Blue Eyes, et al. I’ve got many of the essentials in here (e.g., Burl Ives’ A Holly Jolly Christmas, Johnny Mathis’ *We Need A Little Christmas*, Sinatra’s *Christmas Waltz*).
- [🥁 Soul/R&B/Motown](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_64Fz1c-ODK5lz-j4L4OSBFzZ7B_sq1g) – just what it sounds like: carols with a little soul. It spans the decades so I may be taking a little liberty with genre, because we’ve got the Temptations’ Rudolph but also David Archuleta’s *The First Noel*.

What did I miss? Which awful early 2000s track should be buried with the ghost of Christmas past?

Merry Christmas,

Paul
