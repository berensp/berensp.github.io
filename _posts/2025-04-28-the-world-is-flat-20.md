I just realized that April 5 was the 20th anniversary of the publishing of the bestseller *The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century* by fellow Minnesotan Tom Friedman. I read it at the time and it captured my imagination in many ways: how technology was democratizing opportunity for people across the world, across industries, across professions. If I were to summarize it in a meme (at the time), it would've been like: *hey, look, now anyone with a "smartphone" (Blackberry) can be a freelance journalist!* Not to poke fun, though: we really were waking up to the new era being ushered in by these "convergence devices" in our pockets[^1].

[^1]: I can't remember where I read it—but I wish I could because I think about it a lot—that one of the early decades in the 19th century was obsessed with futurism and futuristic technology (flying cars, and robots doing all of our chores, etc.—real Jetson's stuff), and almost none of it had come true...or let's say none of it had fully lived up to the dream. And the one invention that is mind-blowing and yet *wasn't* predicted was the world's information accessible from a device that lives in our pocket. That much power...and now with astounding ubiquity...and this connectedness has provided a foundation for amazing things to happen.

## Good calls
To his credit Friedman called a number of things pretty correctly:
- **The overall value created by digitization.** The "digital economy" represents >15% of global GDP (as of 2021)[^2]—a stat which might've surprised 2005 Friedman had he heard it.
- **Rise of China and India.** Maybe that wasn't such a crazy bet, but it's true: globalization opened up these markets big time—which is sort of what globalization does, right? And it's followed a predictable maturity curve: start with unskilled manufacturing and call centers; and move into more profitable, more skilled/higher wage work. Then these markets build their own service economies, climbing up the latter further, and allowing high-talent/high-trajectory individuals to stay at home and not have to immigrate to the US. And now here we are in the US in a position of needing to repatriate manufacturing.
- **Creation of workflow software.** I can't remember what was going on in the world of seamless collaboration tools at the time, but Slack wouldn't be founded for another eight or so years, so I'm going to call this one pretty prescient. The Pandemic really accelerated this and other predictions around the virtualization of work.
- **(Technical) education as a competitive advantage.** Again, this one doesn't take a lot of brainpower or assumption of risk, but it's certainly played out this way. And we may be moving toward a skill-based meritocracy (over traditional credentials or location), but there's still long way to go.
- **Rise of outsourcing and offshoring.** Various services moving to lower cost countries. Although this had already been in motion for, what, a decade or so, so Friedman was, I think, predicting that the trend would continue and/or deepen? Anyway, offshoring proved to be a bad idea in many cases, but outsourcing non-critical (extra-core competence) functions is the future.

## Imperfect calls...and things missed
I know: hindsight is 20/20, but it's worth pointing out that there are certain things that are too idealistic in Friedman's framework: the kinds of things that *should* happen according to the models you study in Econ 101; but that in reality are more complex.
- **Digital platforms as economic enablers.** I think most of the disconnect between Friedman's idealism and reality has to do with the fact that markets aren't *that* efficient and distribution in many (most) cases is the deciding factor[^3]. So you could say these new technologies and platforms are indeed value creators for Fortune 100 corporations that have these differentiated capabilities (e.g., Walmart's real-time inventory system or UPS' global supply chain management system or Dell's customized computer assembly [all examples cited by Friedman]), but that value doesn't accrue to the average Joe Schmo driving Uber due to the value extraction from these platforms. Ergo, a bumpiness to the flattening of the world; in which new hierarchies emerge within and among countries—and by bumpiness I mean inequality and wealth polarity.
- **Micro-entrepreneurship.** UMich Business professors C.K. Prahalad (of Bottom of the Pyramid fame) and Aneel Karnani had a live debate on campus one time on BoP and poverty alleviation, and one of the (sub)topics was on micro-entrepreneurship and micro-finance, and in my estimation the evidence favored Karnani who showed that we're not going to lift societies out of poverty by making entrepreneurs out of an entire society—as quaint the idea is—but rather through foreign direct investment (jobs). That said, in the US and other countries, the last couple recessions have driven more people toward entrepreneurship, and new tools are enabling various aspects of the workload, client relationships, etc. And you might say, *hey, the creator economy is enormous!* and you'd be right: well north of $100B now[^4]; but let's return to the distribution question: even if Etsy and Upwork have grown seller and freelancer participants and earnings to some impressive magnitude, what are their take rates and what percent of their communities can earn a living?
- **Borderless capital.** Not that Friedman came up with this idea, but investment that knows no borders is another common globalization refrain, which doesn't seem to bear out: the total amount of the world's capital formation that is generated from foreign direct investment (FDI) is less than 10 percent and roughly stagnant[^5]. On the other hand, World Bank data shows global extreme poverty declined from 1.9B (1990) to ~700M (2019), and the IMF's 2020 World Economic Outlook noted technology-enabled globalization as a significant factor. UN Human Development Index shows improvements in 80% of countries (2005-2019), correlating with digital connectivity.
- **The Political Dimension.** Research identifies policy failures (over technological limitations) as the primary barrier to digital inclusion[^6]. And, of course, the nationalist backlash in developed countries to globalization has been a significant factor (read: Brexit, trade wars). 
- **Market Consolidation.** Instead of democratizing markets, in many (most) cases (at least in tech) sectors became dominated by a handful of monoliths. And so the benefits of globalization accrue to these large incumbents.

[^3]: This is where Chris Dixon's [*Read Write Own*](/books/read-write-own/) does a good job of connecting the dots, because shortly after this *World Is Flat* era the smartphones got even better (not just cameras for freelance journalism) and you had individuals participating in markets on top of web 2.0 platforms (e.g., Uber), which seemed great. And it was only years later when the venture funding ran out and the "take rates" squeezed both the demand and supply sides of something like ridesharing that we wake up to the fact that this isn't the answer. Network operator (Uber Corp.) wins; the network participants (drivers) get kind of screwed.

I cited his piece in the borderless capital point, but Pankaj Ghemawat makes the argument that the globalization is a cool concept—and, *ahem*, sells books—but is far from a reality, save for specific segments of the population within a limited set of large world cities.

## The Contoured World

So where does this leave us? The world became more *interconnected* as Friedman predicted thanks to our technological advancements, but the playing field wasn't "flattened" so much as "contoured" with new peaks of opportunity and valleys of exclusion. Because the distribution of the benefits of tech innovation has everything to do with non-technological factors: our institutions, power structures, tribal tendencies, etc.

## Looking Forward: AI and New Horizons

So the question now becomes: Is it different this time: can AI *really* flatten the world? The optimistic view says yes, in certain respects: democratizing expertise and capabilities that were once the province of educated elites and/or the firms with the biggest balance sheets. But when you consider that 90% of AI research funding concentrated in just eight countries[^7], I think I'll put my chip on us heading for another *reconfiguration* rather than *equalization*: i.e., those with access to computing resources, training data, and AI expertise being well-positioned to gain advantages that may prove significant (i.e. economist David Autor's "superstar effects" where the most advantaged actors capture disproportionate benefits while others face displacement).

And what about more radical visions like Balaji Srinivasan's Network State concept—digital communities/societies based on shared values rather than geography? Fascinating idea, Perhaps it could gain some traction in pockets, but my guess is it's hard to scale (as hard or harder than scaling the cryptocurrency that undergirds it).

Twenty years after Friedman's optimistic vision, we can say that technology creates *potential* pathways, but all the human stuff (our institutions, power structures) and market inefficiencies determine which paths actually get taken. The world isn't flat—it's a waterbed: press down on one spot and watch a bulge appear somewhere else entirely.
