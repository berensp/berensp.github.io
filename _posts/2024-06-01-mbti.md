My maternal extended family *loves* the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), and because we're a large clan, the discussion of how the four dichotomies might explain an individual's behaviors and decisions is nearly endless. I found it all fascinating and fun until a few years ago when I discovered how pseudoscientific it is: i.e., Carl Jung basically made up these categories (perceivers, judgers, etc.) based on his own experience and in the absence of data; and then Katherine Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers come up with the test despite having no formal psychology training.

The actual data show that Myers-Briggs traits:
1. Don't have a bimodal distribution (creating false dichotomies)[^1]
2. Are unreliable (i.e. they subject to change)[^2]
3. Have virtually no predictive power in terms of career or marital happiness

[^2]: In one study, 50% of participants received a different classification when they retested after five weeks. (McCarley and Carskadon, 1983).

That isn't to say we humans can't have preferences and proclivities ("default settings"); it's just that the types that Jung and Myers and Briggs came up with *a priori* ended up being more fortune cookie than scientific instrument. Which is crazy because millions of people rely on it, including [~90% of the Fortune 100 and 200 federal agencies](https://www.vox.com/2014/7/15/5881947/myers-briggs-personality-test-meaningless).

However, there *are* other personality assessment tools that do have greater explanatory/predictive power[^3]:

| Test | R² Range |
| :--- | :--- |
| Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) | 0.30 - 0.60 |
| Big Five Personality Traits | 0.20 - 0.50 |
| Hogan Assessments | 0.20 - 0.50 |
| HEXACO Personality Inventory | 0.20 - 0.50 |
| StrengthsFinder (CliftonStrengths) | 0.20 - 0.40 |
| Discovery Insights | 0.15 - 0.30 |
| Enneagram | 0.10 - 0.20 |
| Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) | 0.10 - 0.20 |

(That first one isn't totally relevant—it's more clinical and used specifically for psychological disorders—but I won't squander the opportunity to shout out to [the homeland](https://berens.co/mn/).)

It does seem that the Big Five is emerging as "the gold standard in the science of personality" due to the body of research behind it[^4], but that the world is slow to catch on.

## Commonalities and Translating One Test to Another

What's funny is that certain MBTI traits map to those of other tests. For example, I'm an N (intuition) on MBTI which maps pretty well to Openness on the Big Five. So the overlaps and connections are plentiful, but then there are other aspects among the tests that are at odds.

One redeeming insight that Jung and Myers and Briggs were on to was the (E)xtraversion/(I)ntroversion thing. The way we use these colloquially is about how much you like to be around people, and that's not totally false, but it really has to do with how you **recharge your batteries** (i.e., introverts need some alone time). Claire Hughes Johnson describes as "think to talk" vs. "talk to think" <mark>link to this YouTube</mark>. This is so true. In fact, her whole framework boils down to introversion/extraversion on one axis, and task-oriented vs. people-oriented on the other. (Not sure which assessment that's from but interesting/potentially useful.) She gives the examples of Extraverted-people oriented types being the classic sales person and the introverted task-oriented type being the accountant/finance guy; but I'm not sure what the introverted people-oriented person looks like (if this is really a 2x2)?

Because I have results from MBTI, Big Five, Enneagram, and Strengths Finder; I fed the results (including detailed breakdowns) of each into ChatGPT to get a metaanalysis of sorts, to understand where there are points of contact versus divergeances. I did this a few times, and paying the most attention to Big Five and Strengths Finder it's interesting to see where the complement each other. For example, for each I've got an intellectual curiosity and love of learning, but also a people orientation that maybe need to be balanced and/or come into play in different situations and contexts.

I expect AI to continue to make these assessments better over time (e.g., honing questions to optimize explanatory power), but in the meantime, use these LLMs like ChatGPT to throw all of the data from these imperfect tests into the mix and see what conclusions can be derived.

## If personality assessments are imperfect let's not lean on them too hard

The conclusion of [Vox's piece on MBTI](https://www.vox.com/2014/7/15/5881947/myers-briggs-personality-test-meaningless) was it's most useful for purposes of...entertainment. But even going up the ladder toward the higher-R² tests (like Strengths Finder and the Big Five), this stuff is potentially useful in terms of increasing self awareness, but I'm suspicious of it being used in a work context without trained facilitators, because it can be misused. It's naturally desirable to try to understand your work colleages (with whom you spend countless hours) on a deeper level, and think through how diversity of personality might impact team dynamics. However, I've never seen it done where there's not value judgments attached to certain types (e.g., extroverted > introverted; achiever > ________; etc.). I think that's not so bizarre when you combine the fact that you're really equipped to interpret results with our tendency to make snap judgments.
