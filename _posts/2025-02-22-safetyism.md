*Stay safe!*

How often do you hear this valediction? Often enough that you probably rarely notice or think about it, but it begs the question *safe from what?* And the correct answer is *from everything, you tottering codpiece!*

Of course, we went overboard with "safetyism" during the Pandemic, but the wheels were set in motion long before that.

A lot of people of an older generation will rehearse something similar to this, but it's my experience as well: in the summers when I was a kid, we'd be anywhere in a three block radius of our house with neighbor friends "until the street lights [came] on" or we heard our mother's distinct "woo-woo" loon call, letting us know it was time to come in for dinner or bath. That's clearly not how it works anymore, and a specific turning point (at least in my home state of Minnesota), was the abduction of Jacob Wetterling. It was disturbing and it rocked the community to the point that it made people rethink their assumptions about safety and trust. And so "helicopter parenting" and "stranger danger" were born, to where now kids are driven everywhere and generally can't leave their parents' sight unless they're under the supervision of a fingerprinted and background-checked adult. (Jonathan Haidt explains this cultural change well in one of his recent books.)

But the rise of safetyism was/is a nuanced and multifactor phenomenon:
- **News media (and now social media)** amplified one-off crimes or accidents, and created the impression that threats are everywhere and all the time. (Basically the above.)
- **Smaller families** (from declining birth rates) meant greater focus on each child, but fewer children also meant increasing...
- **Prosperity** allowed for the purchase of safety (as a feature): e.g., safer cars, houses in safer neighborhoods, air purifiers, organic foods, etc. 
- **Technology** enabled our safety obsession: wireless cameras, location tracking, etc.
- **Attenuation of our institutions (civic/religious)** that helped us trust each other, and process risk and mortality
- **Insurance and legal systems** incentivized extreme risk aversion and "safety theater;" the highly visible, well-documented precautions that may or may not meaningfully reduce risk, but do protect against liability claims (i.e. actual safety versus documented compliance with safety protocols). (Our former corporate daycare was amazing at this.)

And what have we purchased with safetyism? For a time, quite a bit: seatbelts, lead-free toys, etc. produced measurable improvements. And let's just concede that we did have a small crime problem in the US which was addressed—although some of the improvement was the result of demographic, economic, and social shifts[^1].

[^1]: Including removal of lead from gasoline (!). I was this many years old when I found out about this (evidently robust) theory that environmental lead exposure, particularly through leaded gasoline emissions, caused widespread neurodevelopmental damage that increased violent behavior. (Rick Nevin and other researchers believe that lead exposure could explain as much as 50-90% of the variation in violent crime rates.) 

But then came the negative externalities:
- **Postponed adulthood.** Grown children living with their parents indefinitely, being insured by their parents, and even having have their parents phone their manager if there's a problem at work.
- **"Safe spaces," "trigger warnings," "microaggressions".** What began as concern and sensitivity has evolved into a doctrine of emotional safety; first normalized, then celebrated, and finally codified in our universities, corporations, and government agencies.
- **Hombres emasculados.** As institutions and bureaucracies replaced men's traditional role as protectors, they stripped away a core source of meaning and identity. This void helped create Jordan Peterson, who speaks to young men who find themselves obsolete in a world where safety comes prepackaged.

On that last point, Peterson's doctrine of personal responsibility entails ditching your comforts and taking on sufferings and burdens as a means to personal growth and meaning. A few men from my church and I just embarked on this faith-based fraternity program together, and I noticed it right away how good it is to have quality guy time—and not just drinking buddies, but something that goes a little deeper.

And, in fact, this program is based on asceticism, which leads me to my spiritual/religious points: our safety culture has made us a little weaker and softer, but it's a vicious cycle because that weakness/softness makes us desire (and demand) that someone else take us of us with comforts and safety. Even comforts like snacking—guilty right here—starts out as an innocuous indulgence, but the "we are what we repeatedly do" aphorism applies equally to virtue *and* vice. Apart from any religious tradition, people intuit that character is built through suffering, which includes:
- Physical suffering (immediate, concrete): e.g., the current ice bath craze, or the popularity of Stoicism *or*
- Psychological suffering (potential suffering): i.e., ditching your psychological safety in favor of adventure (e.g., the hobbits leaving the comfort of the Shire to go on their adventure, or Twelve apostles leaving their families and livelihoods to follow Jesus).

Did Christ Himself play it safe? Clearly not, hence the Cross. But "to love is to suffer and there can be no love otherwise," says Fyodor Dostoevsky. And what's the opposite of love? Hate, right? No, apathy. Or perhaps *acedia*, which the desert monks believed to come from being "too safe" in their cells. But the other sin it relates to is idolatry: worshipping one's own life or safety above all else (e.g., the present longevity movement of which Bryan Johnson is the poster child). Rather, *propter vitam vivendi perdere causas,* roughly translated as "to lose the reasons for living, for the sake of life."

Alexander Tytler Cycle predicted this stage for us—well, for everyone: after abundance comes complacency and apathy, then dependence, and finally bondage.

And isn't it true that safetyism is a classic "first world problem"? The craziest things that happened with regard to psychological safety came about during our recent zero interest rate environment (i.e. good times); whereas when the economic winds blow the other way, it's more like "yeah, get back to work".

## How do we right the ship?

It has to happen at multiple levels, but subsidiarity demands it begins with me and my household:

### Local
- Seek out high-quality information and news media as a means of quantifying risks (distinguishing from hype).
- Adopt Nassim Taleb's Anti-Fragile (Stoic?) framework: do hard things (advertisities make you grow), go through life as a "flâneur", and develop an anti-education.
- Employ parenting strategies that foster resilience (e.g., my own take on a Hunger Games of sorts?).

### Global
- (Concomitant with #1 above) Have mechanisms to score the trustworthiness of information sources. (Easier said than done...)
- Reform legal liability in the US
- Borrow whatever it is that allows [Japanese children to commute by subway](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-28/in-japan-small-children-take-the-subway-and-run-errands-alone), while combating the forces that shout down the families that [try to engender the same kind of independence in their children](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/01/16/i-let-my-9-year-old-ride-the-subway-alone-i-got-labeled-the-worlds-worst-mom/).

To be clear, safety is not a terrible thing—Maslow filed it under "basic needs," and as a dad and husband I want a certain amount. But we've crowned it as one of the highest goods, which is foolish and misguided. Let us swing the pendulum back the other direction.
