*Stay safe!*

How often do you hear this valediction? In fact, it's so common you probably rarely notice and/or think about it, but it begs the question *safe from what?* And, of course, the answer is *from everything!*

Of course, we went overboard with "safetyism" during the Pandemic, but the wheels were set in motion long before that.

A lot of people of my generation and older will rehearse something similar to this, but in the summers, when I was a kid we'd get on our bikes go all over with our neighbor friends "until the street lights came on" or we heard our mother's distinct "woooo-wooo" loon call, letting us know it was time to come in. That's clearly not how it works anymore, but a specific turning point (at least in my home state of Minnesota), was the abduction of Jacob Wetterling. It was disturbing and it rocked the community to the point that it made people rethink their assumptions about safety and trust. And so "helicopter parenting" and "stranger danger" were born, to where now kids are driven everywhere and can't leave their parents' sight. (Jonathan Haidt articulates this cultural change well in one of his recent books.)

But of course, this is a nuanced and multifactor phenomenon with other forces contributing to the rise of safetyism:
1. Prosperity allows for the purchase of safety (as a feature): e.g., safer cars, houses in safer neighborhoods, air purifiers, organic foods, etc. 
2. Technology enables our obsession: wireless cameras, location tracking, etc.
3. Attenuation of our institutions (civic/religious) that helped us trust each other, and process risk and mortality
4. Insurance/legal system incentivizes extreme risk aversion. Our former corporate daycare was great at "safety theater;" the highly visible, well documented precautions that may or may not meaningfully reduce risk, but do protect against liability claims (i.e. actual safety versus documented compliance with safety protocols).
5. News media (and now social media) amplifies one-off crimes or accidents, and makes us think the threats are everywhere and all the time.
6. Smaller families (from declining birth rates) means greater focus on each child

And what have we purchased with safetyism? For a time, quite a bit: seatbelts, lead-free toys, etc. produced measurable improvements. And we did have a small crime problem in the US which was course-corrected—although some of the improvement was the result of demographic, economic, and social shifts[^1].

[^1]: Including removal of lead from gasoline (!). I was this many years old when I found out about this (evidently robust) theory that environmental lead exposure, particularly through leaded gasoline emissions, caused widespread neurodevelopmental damage that increased violent behavior. (Rick Nevin and other researchers believe that lead exposure could explain as much as 50-90% of the variation in violent crime rates.) 

But then came the overshoot:
- Postponed adulthood. Grown children living with their parents indefinitely, being insured by their parents, and even having have their parents phone their manager if there's a problem at work.
- Physical safety is table stakes; psychological/emotional safety is all the rage ("safe spaces," "trigger warnings," "microaggressions") → institutionalization
- Technology/AI enables constant monitoring and safety optimization

## Masculinity Crisis

Also I wonder if there's a part of the story that is attributable to men. Men being the traditional protectors, ensurers of safety. And to a certain extent excessive safety concerns and protocols has had an emasculating effect, and produces a crisis of purpose for males. After all, isn't this what produced Jordan Peterson: the void left from the vanishing of meaning from the lives of young adult males? His is a doctrine of personal responsibility which entails ditching your comforts and taking on sufferings and burdens as a means to personal growth and meaning. A few men from my church and I just embarked on this faith-based fraternity program together, and I noticed it right away: how good it is to have guy time—and not just drinking buddies; but something that goes a little deeper.

## A Spiritual Dimension

And, in fact, this program is based on asceticism, which leads me to my spiritual/religious points: our safety culture comforts have made us a little weaker and softer. Even things like snacking—guilty—starts out as an innocuous indulgence, but the "we are what we repeatedly do" aphorism applies equally to virtue *and* vice. Apart from any religious tradition, people intuitively know that character is built through suffering, which could be physical suffering (e.g., the current ice bath craze, or the popularity of Stoicism) or psychological suffering (i.e., ditching your psychological safety in favor of adventure [e.g., the hobbits leaving the comfort of the Shire to go on their adventure, the Twelve apostles leaving their families and livelihoods to go on a great adventure]). Did Christ Himself play it safe? Clearly not, hence the Cross. But "to love is to suffer and there can be no love otherwise," says Fyodor Dostoevsky. And what's the opposite of love? Hate, right? No, apathy. Or perhaps *acedia*, a "noonday demon," as the desert monks called it.

## The Tytler Cycle

Alexander Tytler Cycle predicted this for us: after abundance comes complacency and apathy, then dependence, and finally bondage. And isn't it true that safetyism is a classic "first world problem"? The craziest things that happened with regard to psychological safety came about during our zero interest rate environment; whereas when the economic winds blow the other way, it's more like "yeah, get back to work".

## How do we course correct?
- Engender the means of distinguishing necessary vs. unnecessary risks. Part of this implies trustworthy information sources that aren't trying to distort reality. (This is increasingly easier said than done, I know.)
- Even though he's sometime's obnoxious, Nassim Taleb's Anti-Fragile (Stoic?) framework is good stuff: do hard things (advertisities make you grow), go through life as a "flâneur", and develop an anti-education.
- At an institutional level, do we need reform? Like legal liability in the US, for example.
- Think globally, act locally: what are the parenting strategies that I can employ to foster resilience with our kids (e.g., a real-life Hunger Games of sorts?).
- Borrow from other societies: Japan empowering their children to commute by subway; balancing Athenian sophistication and refinement with Spartan austerity and hardiness.

Ultimately, safety is a particular good—I proclaim that as a dad and husband—but we've crowned it as one of the highest good, which is a mistake. Let us swing the pendulum back the other direction.
