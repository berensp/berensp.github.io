Today marks the 60th quadrennial presidential election which sounds like a grand affair, worthy of celebration, and yet here we are with our two somewhat underwhelming presidential candidates. *Sigh*.

Party politics aside, as I complete my ballot (with my trusty sidekick [see below]) and head to the polling station, the notion I'm contemplating is this crazy style of government we've got here in California and locally: **the direct democracy**.

"Direct democracy" sounds great, right? After all, America is a bastion of *democracy* and if it's somehow going *direct* to the people then all the better, right?

Wrong. Turns out it's terrible. And this experiment has been run continuously in California since 1911 so we've got a fair amount of data.

Exempli gratia:

> **Proposition 2.** Authorizes $10 billion in general obligation bonds for repair, upgrade, and construction of facilities at K–12 public schools (including charter schools), community colleges, and career technical education programs, including for improvement of health and safety conditions and classroom upgrades. Requires annual audits. *Fiscal Impact:* Increased state costs of about $500 million annually for 35 years to repay the bond. *Supporters:* California Teachers Association; California School Nurses Organization; Community College League of California *Opponents:* Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association

This is common—in fact at a local level we've got the same thing (Prop A): *do you want this [display shiny object]? I mean, you don't hate our school-aged children, do you?* Nevermind that school facility maintenance is among the very first line items the government is supposed to have on the budget, paid for with our existing taxes.

But even if you thought it was a laudable proposal, a worthwhile investment; how would you evaluate it? Like what happens if we don't do the $10B? Does it get funded another way? How much direct vs. indirect costs? How do we know $10B the right number? Etc.

I have attempted to "go deep" on this or that proposition in the past: get both sides' arguments and counterarguments, seek out as much analysis as possible, do my own due diligence with some source material, etc. It takes a fair amount of time. And we have 25 propositions between state and local this time around.

And even once you've arrived at your well-informed answer and your confidence is brimming, you realize another problem: how does everything hang together in a fiscal budget? It's hard to see it, and you're typically not making tradeoffs on these props; rather they're simply binary choices: do the thing or don't. So it's easy to say "yes" but not fully understand the ROI or how everything else in the budget might be adjusted to accommodate said proposition.

You know, it's almost like you'd want a small group of people whom the *demos* trusts and feels would be competent and fair-minded to represent us in deciding such matters.

There are occasions when the features of direct democracy are useful. Like when you have to recall a district attorney whose woke ideologies come to be at odds with the very duties he's elected to carry out.

But for the most part, when we look at California, we should conclude that the democratic republic—not the direct democracy—is the way to go.
