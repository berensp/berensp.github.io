*Goodbye, Everybody. I've got to go.* Okay, yes, I'm aware too many people have already abandoned FB for me to be awarded any trendsetter points, but hey.

## Why I joined Facebook (back in '07)
- Because Friendster had peaked and was waning
- I was enough years out of school where reconnecting with old friends (a.k.a. posting on walls and sending some pokes) was a novelty and so rewarding: a superpower making possible a look into the personal details of someone's life without actually engaging them in conversation. Whereas you used to need to "catch up" with someone to find out they had a job change, or suffered a death, or started a new relationship; it was offered up to you at no cost.
	- I remember my friend Meera observing the strangeness of this after a college reunion, noting how bizarre it was to be up to date on everyone's news and all the gossip‚Äîof acquaintances; not close buds‚Äî*before* the reunion had even begun. It's hard to remember how odd this was at the time...before it was normalized.
- I did perceive a need for *pull* communications (vs. *push*). (Maybe we all did?) Remember pre-Facebook you'd inadvertently end up on one of these group email distlists and the content (or the frequency) maybe wasn't exactly to your liking (e.g. your neighbor's joke of the day email)? Then how do you opt out gracefully (üò¨)? Facebook delivered that *pull* ability and means to regain agency (i.e. I can read or not read that joke, and the posting party doesn't need to know).

## Why I stayed
- The platform got better (wall postings expanded to photos and videos and messages) ‚Üí more memories captured ‚Üí more friends jumped on ‚Üí more stickiness
	- Growing up you were never deluged with birthday wishes‚Äîit was just your family and few close friends who would know your birthday‚Äîbut then with your special day being promulgated to 100s of FB friends: wow, the love!
- Network externalities ‚Üí FOMO

## Why leave?

### Just the typical litany
- Disinformation masquerading as news
- Conspiracy mongering
- Echo chamber / polarization
- Social-validation
- Outrage reward[^1]
- Toxicity for teen girls[^2]
- Being productized
- It generally "ripping apart the social fabric of how society works" via "dopamine-driven feedback loops"[^3]

### I guess I don't really have 1,284 friends

I genuinely like people a lot...and like a lot of people. The institutions and communities I've been fortunate to be a part of have surrounded me with endlessly wonderful and lovely humans. And as much as I hope to get to know everyone on the deepest level in the next life, I'm afraid I subscribe to the concept of [Dunbar's Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number) (i.e. we're capable of managing relationships‚Äîstaying in contact at least once per year and knowing how friends relate to others‚Äîwith roughly 150 people). It's a sad reality when you acknolwedge that there are so many fabulous people out there. But it suggests the need for intentionality with friendships and relationships; the opposite of what we did for years with Facebook "friending".

## Not intending to become a hermit

Nor do I want to discourage contact. Just want to do it on my own terms; not those of Facebook, Inc.

I've already been running my own personal experiment to see if I can abstain from Facebook/Instagram for my own personal wellness. I've been able to check only occasionally, and deleted the apps from my phone, but the problem is that having active profiles gives the impression one's still available but just (annoyingly) unresponsive to posts, messenger pings, etc. So it's time to throw the steering wheel out the window and commit to other media.

So please do still be in touch; and here's how:
- **Events / Galas / Symposia:** send me an email or a calendar item to my email. (If we have to use Evite...maybe I'll just come back to Facebook.)
- **Messaging:** [Signal](https://signal.org/install), [Keybase](https://keybase.io/berens),¬†KakaoTalk, [Telegram](https://t.me/berensp)
- **Photos**: [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com), [VSCO](https://vsco.co/berensp), [Box](https://box.com), etc.
- **Professional stuff:** [AngelList](https://angel.co/u/berens), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/berensp/)
- **Social media üòÅ:** [Twitter](https://twitter.com/berensp)[^4], [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@berens)[^5]

[^4]: I still have Twitter, which is maybe hypocritical though I'd argue it's less toxic and has some greater utility. (But maybe I'll take [Balaji Srinivasan's advice and eventually exit Twitter, too](https://balajis.com/how-to-gradually-exit-twitter/).)

[^5]: [Mastodon and the fediverse](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/technology/social-media-privacy.html) should be the answer to social media's ills, but we all know there's a network externalities problem.

I will miss the address book - but I think I just need to build and maintain my own - so please keep me updated with your
- postal address
- email address
- mobile phone
- birthday, anniversary
