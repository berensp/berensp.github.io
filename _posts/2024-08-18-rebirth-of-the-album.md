title: Rebirth of the Album

I have long consulted my brother's good taste in various categories: clothes, cooking, décor, but most of all music—I can't count how many great bands he's introduced me to.

And so last weekend as we were hanging out at his house, I was admiring his record collection, which he's casually been building over the last decade.

He loves music…though he's not an *audiophile* in the sense that he doesn't make audio quality claims like, "Hey Man, the White Album must be heard on vinyl to hear the full range of sound and all of its intricacies."[^1]

[^1]: I don't believe the average listener can detect the subtle differences in sound quality between vinyl and other formats, without really paying attention and doing some side-by-side comparisons. Just like the average palette can't detect "good wine" from "bad wine".

But he does talk about enjoying the return to the analog, tactile experience of another of life’s categories that have been digitized—although he does have an e-reader whereas [I hold firm to the paper books](editio-princeps.html). He’s the aesthete, and so appreciates the beautiful jackets, the displaying of a well-curated collection, et cetera:

## The Benefit of Friction

I grew up around [some records](/vinyl/) (our sister's), and so I know the LP ("long play" record) was literally meant for that: to be played a long time…well, at least one side of an album. Because if you wanted to skip or replay a track you had to get up, walk over to the record player, pick up the needle, and try to set it down precisely between tracks, which, when you invariably missed to the left or the right of the target, was this slightly unsettling experience. (Also, you had the sense you were putting wear and tear on the needle with each lift and set.)

Anyway, they were designed to be listened through, and albums were created as not a haphazard assemblage of the ten or so songs the band happened to churn out most recently, but a carefully curated collection of tracks that often hung together to present a story or carry a motif. Add the cover art and the liner notes and you had a work of art. Okay, that may sound a little idealistic and naïve as there were certainly bands that had a hit single and filled the requisite tracks around it, as well as the stifling recording contracts[^2] that pushed artists hard to pump out songs by certain deadlines in order to get paid. 

[^2]: At one point Ben Folds had a recording contract where he was required to write and record 13.6 songs in some year...which prompted him to write [this one](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=MJPhmQvH9bc&si=S2dIou57wJvk18yj).

But the best albums were indeed works of art, and the record player introduced the requisite friction that allowed you to listen through and gradually fall in love with it. As opposed to our streaming culture today, where you might play a favorite track or two from an artist, but then jump to the next artist—or, more likely, let the algorithm take you there. Rick Beato also talks about how scarcity is part of the equation: the fact that you had to save up your money, go down to the record store and buy it for a good chunk of change[^3]. Versus today where you’ve got access to the universe of music for what used to be the price of an album, ergo, the value of any one album (or song) is reduced.

So it's a happy thing that we're in the "vinyl revival": vinyl unit sales now exceed that of CD; and vinyl demand outstrips supply 2:1 (per Mixmag). And of course this is a "vibe" thing, but I hope it takes us back to really taking in and falling in love with certain albums.

## My Top Albums of All Time

Like you, there are all kinds of bands and albums and songs I love. But for an album to be among the very best, it's got to be magnificent on multiple levels (musically, emotionally, philosophically). It's got to age well, as you listen more deeply and hear more. Even though I love some of them, I'm excluding greatest hits and compilation albums because that's cheating—otherwise I'd be forced to throw on Elton John's *Greatest Hits* (1974) and Bob Marley's *Legend*[^4].

[^4]: *Legend* is a timeless classic, but I'm also kind of with John Bonham on the boredom factor of reggae as a genre.

And so, the definitive list:

[^5]: I must give first place to the greatest rock band of all time, and *IV* is probably up against *II* with but in my estimation they are the best rock band of all time and this their opus magnus. [*'Led Zeppelin IV': How Band Struck Back at Critics With 1971 Masterpiece*](https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/led-zeppelin-iv-how-band-struck-back-at-critics-with-1971-masterpiece-126755/)
[^6]: Hey, a son of Minneapolis. And it's some of the only overlap with my wife who doesn't dig classic rock *per se*.
[^7]: Very difficult to pick the #1 Beatles album. Revolver is probably it (despite *Yellow Submarine* being a children's song), but then again each of the greatest albums has its token cheesy song or two: *[Rubber Soul](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lirCIxLpU2odTVLZ_Sbo1wZaeu5IStivs&feature=share)*, [*Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kx7E82d6vaFm76vkXtcvzr89qsh8zaqEs&feature=share), [*Abbey Road*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lsAB2g0gXCjTs5AbUrjZOmQVihnAcvGgg&feature=share), or [*White Album*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_ngFkZaiOccd84mOWCf4mZKbJrvsPzm8BE&feature=share).
[^8]: Dylan's greatest album is also a judgment call, but I'm going with *Blonde on Blonde*...especially b/c [it's a combo of New York and Mpls. musicians](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-of-all-time-1062063/bob-dylan-blood-on-the-tracks-2-1063224/) and it just has the best set of tunes. [*Blood On The Tracks*](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-of-all-time-1062063/bob-dylan-blood-on-the-tracks-2-1063224/) is probably #2 and then [*Hwy 61 Revisited*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nIDvA68GQU6dFSErUt5wnrNRt0d0jnMVk&feature=share).
[^9]: On repeat at Wine Night in Mod 28A.
[^10]: Nostalgia for college.
[^11]: Nostalgia for Minnesota.
[^12]: Hey, as an acoustic guitar-strummin' Wisconsinite by birth, *Re: Stacks* may very well be one of the most beautiful songs ever written. Allow myself one melancholic album. Left to my own devices I could fill the list with sad, wistful albums.
[^13]: Cliché, but, hey, I want it. I once had a friend disparage me for my admission to liking of Mozart. *Pffft.* It's a hipster tendency that constantly needs to ditch anything that is too popular and too familiar. *Achtung Baby* scores higher on the Rolling Stones Greatest Albums of All Time (#63), and would give me something at least in the 90s decade (1991), but I'm sticking to my guns.
[^14]: Weirdly, I'm not an enormous Fleetwood Mac fan, but this album is without a bad song. Just full of hits.
[^15]: Ike is my "family's rockband", thanks to Uncle John discovering him years ago...a Marquette connection. Many night-before-Thanksgiving shows at First Ave. And proud this is my sole 21st century pick.

## Honorable mention:

- Fleet Foxes - [*Fleet Foxes*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nBGuQNB76A4QwoaeGVeQwig5k_ea4YAXA&feature=share) (2008)
- The Doors - [*The Doors*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_ncguZB2yUq0StUzwpUWz7qaNJO-lcAeis&feature=share) (1967)
- This is blasphemy to not bring in a Stones album, but my likes span their albums. If I had to pick it'd probably be [*Sticky Fingers*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mnwoM8u3_ggNMtvgV6VTP_gsrt86aRboc&feature=share) even though I know the correct answer is supposed to be [*Exile on Main St.*]((https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nUN0Se9MxUILr7oxbyaFLW9j6rOcU8JxQ&feature=share)), or maybe [*Let It Bleed*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_majeP4GW8tafu1VFAPhs9ABgwjPh7qKGI&feature=share). Rollingstone mag has *Exile* as #6 on 500 albums of all time; Let It Bleed as #32; [*Beggars Banquet*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lxhcv7ileyWBhOcUx-9UOP_R5z5AHND7A&feature=share) as #58. And *Sticky Fingers* as #64.
- Guns N' Roses - [*Appetite For Destruction Album*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kfHF0whENLGG_jS2pYWUbW2r2rRyJSOuw&feature=share) (1987) - this is both serious and a little tongue in cheek. I mean this album seriously rocked and was monumental...but lyrically it's also kind of absurd. So while it's refreshing to turn this up after not having given it a listen for some time, it probably doesn't make the Top 10 either.
- Elton John - [*Madman Across The Water*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_m9zZ9yaX0umpOUzU1A-PPVqZ4fBqL9Xb4&feature=share) (1971)
- Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers - [Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_n-pdHwksMVR4C5B1H6_dmtNkJ-iKVgSKo) (1976) [https://www.loudersound.com/features/10-best-singer-songwriter-albums](https://www.loudersound.com/features/10-best-singer-songwriter-albums)
- Simon & Garfunkel - [*Bridge Over Troubled Water*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mce00rQ-71wrhnKWQ4QbNqON4BFCaIEVQ) (1970)
- Dawes - [*North Hills*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lpPUr8Z5NMH3vN0_Y_ddBsd2iF_Rl1lNU&feature=share) (2009)
- Steely Dan - [*Aja*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_ns_zqCLjZ6CXF0cji36OJNwTjH1YRYO_4&feature=share) (1977). My jazz pick if I didn't have *Kind Of Blue*.
- Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young - [*Déjà vu*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_neUnMuHswIr4wB5qPiV5iozF-550Cz3k8&feature=share) (1970)
- The Band - [*Music From Big Pink*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mm4Y_hc15Xsw2Vu0Ptd-yM23-xpdccqw0&feature=share) (1968). Shout out to Dad. I'm sure he wouldn't be described as a music fan, but, Man, did he love this album.

## Other thoughts
- Other categories to consider: a best live albums list (e.g., *Live at Leeds*, *Frampton Comes Alive*, Nirvana MTV), movie soundtracks
- Man, [1971 was my year](https://www.google.com/search?q=albums+released+in+1971))...too bad I hadn't been born in the mid-50s. Perhaps we have our answer to: [WTF happened in 1971?](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/)
- Why so much old stuff? Nostalgia plays no small role in what you might consider the most important music, so this is as much a diary entry or memoir as anything[^16]. This should matter more than what's in which ranking on the [Rolling Stone's Top 500 Albums of All Time](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-of-all-time-1062063/).
