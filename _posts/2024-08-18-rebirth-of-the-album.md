Hanging out at my brother's house last weekend, I found myself admiring his vinyl collection, which he's casually been building over the last decade.

<center><img src="/assets/og/bro_vinyl_station.jpg" alt="bro vinyl station"></center>

He's got excellent musical sensibilities (i.e., introduced me to many of my now-favorite bands), but he's not an *audiophile* in the sense that he wouldn't assert that, for example, *the White Album must be heard on vinyl to experience the full range of sound and all of its intricacies.*[^1]

[^1]: And, by the way, I seriously doubt the average listener can detect the subtle differences in sound quality between vinyl and other formats, without really paying attention and doing some side-by-side comparisons. Just like the average palette can't detect "great wine" from "decent wine".

So he loves his music, and goes the vinyl route because he enjoys the analog, tactile experience of the record: the beautiful jackets, the displaying of a well-curated collection, et cetera. (Funny, though: he does use an e-reader whereas [I hold firm to the paper books](editio-princeps.html), so if he's an aesthete, it's category-specific.)

## The Benefit of Friction

While I appreciate the aesthetic and vibe of vinyl—and to be clear I haven't started my own record collection—I like vinyl for a different reason: because it celebrates the album.

I grew up around records ([our sister's and parents'](/vinyl/)), and so I was baptized in the technology. We had an equal share of 45s and LPs more or less. The LP ("long play" record) was literally meant for that: to be played a long while…well, at least one side of an album. Because if you wanted to skip or replay a track you had to get up, walk over to the record player, pick up the needle, and try to set it down precisely between tracks, which, when you invariably missed to the left or the right of the target, was this slightly unsettling experience. (Also, you had the sense you were putting wear and tear on the needle with each lift and set.)

<center><img src="/assets/og/needle-placement.png" alt="tricky needle placement"></center>

Anyway, they were designed to be listened through, and (concept) albums were (supposed to be, though not always[^2]) created as not a haphazard assemblage of the ten or so songs, some hits surrounded by filler tracks; but a carefully curated collection of tracks that often hung together to present a cohesive story or carry a motif.

[^2]: Lest I come across idealistic and naïve, a disclaimer that I realize there were/are plenty of bands that had a hit single and filled the requisite tracks around it, as well as the stifling recording contracts that pushed artists hard to pump out songs by certain deadlines in order to get paid. In fact, at one point Ben Folds had a recording contract where he was required to write and record 13.6 songs in some year...which prompted him to write [this sardonic ditty](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=MJPhmQvH9bc&si=S2dIou57wJvk18yj).

The best albums were indeed works of art, and the record player introduced the requisite friction that allowed you to listen through and gradually fall in love with it. And you really knew an album when upon the completion of one track, your brain anticipated the intro notes or beat to the next.

As opposed to our streaming culture today, where you might play a favorite track or two from an artist, but then jump to the next artist—or, more likely, allow the algorithm to steer you through its mixtape.

Rick Beato also talks about how scarcity is part of the equation: the fact that you had to save up your money, go down to the record store and buy it for a good chunk of change[^3]. Versus today where you've got access to the universe of music for what used to be the price of an album, ergo, the value of any one album (or song) is reduced.

So it's a happy thing that we're in the "vinyl revival": vinyl unit sales now exceed that of CD; and vinyl demand outstrips supply 2:1 (per Mixmag). And of course this is a "vibe" thing, but I hope it takes us back to really taking in and falling in love with certain albums.

## My Top Albums

For an album to be among the very best, it's got to be magnificent on multiple levels (musically, emotionally, philosophically). It's got to age well, as you listen more deeply and hear more. Even though I love some of them, greatest hits and compilation albums are excluded because that's cheatin', Man—otherwise I'd be forced to throw in Elton John's *Greatest Hits* (1974) and Bob Marley's *Legend*[^4].

[^4]: *Legend* is a timeless classic, but I'm also kind of with John Bonham on the boredom factor of reggae as a genre.

And so, here's my definitive list, which you could buy and pay for by taking a two-year break from your music streaming service:

[^5]: I must give first place to the greatest rock band of all time, and *IV* is probably up against *II* with but in my estimation they are the best rock band of all time and this their opus magnus. [*'Led Zeppelin IV': How Band Struck Back at Critics With 1971 Masterpiece*](https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/led-zeppelin-iv-how-band-struck-back-at-critics-with-1971-masterpiece-126755/)
[^6]: A son of Minneapolis. And it's some of the only overlap with my wife who doesn't dig classic rock *per se*.
[^7]: Very difficult to pick the #1 Beatles album, but for me *Revolver* edges out *[Rubber Soul](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lirCIxLpU2odTVLZ_Sbo1wZaeu5IStivs&feature=share)*, [*Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kx7E82d6vaFm76vkXtcvzr89qsh8zaqEs&feature=share), [*Abbey Road*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lsAB2g0gXCjTs5AbUrjZOmQVihnAcvGgg&feature=share), [*White Album*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_ngFkZaiOccd84mOWCf4mZKbJrvsPzm8BE&feature=share).
[^8]: Dylan's greatest album is also a tough call, which you're not going to convince everyone on, but *Blonde on Blonde* is a masterpiece, and I dig that it was [a combo of New York and Minneapolis musicians](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-of-all-time-1062063/bob-dylan-blood-on-the-tracks-2-1063224/). For me [*Blood On The Tracks*](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-of-all-time-1062063/bob-dylan-blood-on-the-tracks-2-1063224/) is probably #2 and then [*Hwy 61 Revisited*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nIDvA68GQU6dFSErUt5wnrNRt0d0jnMVk&feature=share).
[^9]: On repeat at Wine Night in Mod 28A.
[^10]: Nostalgia for college.
[^11]: Nostalgia for Minnesota.
[^12]: Hey, as an acoustic guitar-strummin' Wisconsinite by birth, *Re: Stacks* may very well be one of the most beautiful songs ever written. Allow myself one melancholic album. Left to my own devices I could fill the list with sad, wistful albums.
[^13]: Cliché, but, hey, I want it. I once had a friend disparage me for my admission to liking of Mozart. *Pffft.* It's a hipster tendency that constantly needs to ditch anything that is too popular and too familiar. *Achtung Baby* scores higher on the Rolling Stones Greatest Albums of All Time (#63), and would give me something at least in the 90s decade (1991), but I'm sticking to my guns.
[^14]: Weirdly, I'm not an enormous Fleetwood Mac fan, but this album is without a bad song. Just full of hits.
[^15]: Ike is my "family's rockband", thanks to Uncle John discovering him years ago...a Marquette connection. Many night-before-Thanksgiving shows at First Ave. And proud this is my sole 21st century pick.

## Honorable mentions
- The Doors – [*The Doors*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_ncguZB2yUq0StUzwpUWz7qaNJO-lcAeis&feature=share) (1967)
- The Band – [*Music From Big Pink*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mm4Y_hc15Xsw2Vu0Ptd-yM23-xpdccqw0&feature=share) (1968). Shout out to Dad. I'm sure he wouldn't be described as a music fan, but, Man, did he love this album.
- Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young – [*Déjà vu*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_neUnMuHswIr4wB5qPiV5iozF-550Cz3k8&feature=share) (1970)

I know it's blasphemy to leave out the Stones from the top albums chart, but their best tunes are too distributed across their albums IMO. *Sticky Fingers* is probably a little controversial; the correct answer is supposed to be [*Exile on Main St.*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nUN0Se9MxUILr7oxbyaFLW9j6rOcU8JxQ&feature=share) or maybe [*Let It Bleed*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_majeP4GW8tafu1VFAPhs9ABgwjPh7qKGI&feature=share)[^16].

- Steely Dan – [*Aja*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_ns_zqCLjZ6CXF0cji36OJNwTjH1YRYO_4&feature=share) (1977). My jazz pick if I didn't have *Kind Of Blue*.
- Guns N' Roses – [*Appetite For Destruction Album*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kfHF0whENLGG_jS2pYWUbW2r2rRyJSOuw&feature=share) (1987).
- Original Broadcast Cast thereof – [*Les Misérables*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nOFrqAkBC4ZCdAsHqc0pPuUydlpIRtqg0) (1987). Different genre but I'm throwing it in.
- Dawes – [*North Hills*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lpPUr8Z5NMH3vN0_Y_ddBsd2iF_Rl1lNU&feature=share) (2009)

[^16]: Rolling Stone has *Exile* as #6 on the 500 albums of all time; *Let It Bleed* as #32; [*Beggars Banquet*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lxhcv7ileyWBhOcUx-9UOP_R5z5AHND7A&feature=share) as #58. And *Sticky Fingers* coming in at #64.

## Other thoughts
- Other categories to consider:
	- Live albums (e.g., *Live at Leeds*, *Frampton Comes Alive!*, Nirvana MTV)
	- Movie soundtracks (e.g., Wes Anderson films)
	- Acoustic performances (e.g., Dave Matthews Band *Live at Luther College*)
- Man, [1971 was my year](https://www.google.com/search?q=albums+released+in+1971)...too bad I hadn't been born in the mid-50s. Perhaps we have our answer to [WTF happened in 1971?](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/)
- Why so much old stuff? Nostalgia plays no small role in what you might consider the most important music, so this is as much a diary entry or memoir as anything[^18]. This should matter more than what's in which ranking on the [Rolling Stone's Top 500 Albums of All Time](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-of-all-time-1062063/).
