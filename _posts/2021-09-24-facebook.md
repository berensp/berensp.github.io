Goodbye, Everybody. I've got to go.

I realize too many people have already abandoned FB for me to be awarded any cool points; but more on popularity later...

## Why I joined Facebook (Why we all did?)
- Because Friendster waning
- I was enough years out of school where reconnecting with old friends (a.k.a. posting on walls + pokes) was a novelty and so rewarding. And then this voyeuristic superpower where you could peer into the personal details of someone's life without even engaging them in conversation. Whereas you used to need to "catch up" with someone to find out they had a job change, or suffered a death, or started a new relationship; it was offered up to you at no cost. I remember my friend Meera commenting on the oddity of this after a college reunion, noting how bizarre it was to be up to date on everyone's news and all the gossip *before* the reunion had even begun—and we're talking acquaintances; not close buds.
- There *is* a time and place for *pull* communications (vs. *push*). A *push* communication in the analog world is ringing your doorbell with no advanced notice. Remember pre-Facebook you'd get on these group emails and the content (or maybe the frequency) wasn't to your liking (e.g. your neighbor's joke of the day email)? Then how do you opt out gracefully? Social media's *pull* certainly has that value. So I have Twitter- I'm still (hypocritically) on other social media platforms (though arguably less toxic). (Maybe I'll take BALAJI SRINIVASAN's advice and eventually exit Twitter, tooEventually Twitter, too https://balajis.com/how-to-gradually-exit-twitter/). Mastodon and the fedicerse should be the answer but we all know there's a network externalities problem.But Keybase verifies 
Perhaps a happy surprise, but also definitely an interruption and a request (demand) for immediate response. It's why I resisted moving to text messages for casual outreach. Email was good for "Hey, how have you been? Wanna grab coffee?" and SMS was good for "Hey, I'm outside. Come out." And then the Millennials ruined everything.
- And through the years as FB added functionality so many memories have been captured through messages and photos and videos. Growing up you were never deluged with birthday wishes—it was just your family and few close friends who would know your birthday—but then with your special day being promulgated to 100s of FB friends: wow, the love!

## Why leave?

### All the usual stuff:
- Disinformation masquerading as news
- Conspiracy mongering
- Echo chamber / polarization
- Social-validation
- Outrage reward[^1]
- Toxicity for teen girls[^2]
- Being productized
- It generally "ripping apart the social fabric of how society works" via "dopamine-driven feedback loops"[^3]

### I don't really have 1,284 friends

I genuinely like people a lot...and like a lot of people. The various institutions and communities I've been privileged to be a part of have surrounded me with people who are endlessly wonderful and lovely (in infinitely different ways). And as much as I hope to get to know everyone on the deepest level in the next life, I'm afraid I subscribe to the concept of [Dunbar's Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number) (i.e. we're capable of managing relationships—staying in contact at least once per year and knowing how friends relate to others—with about 150 people). It's a sad reality when you acknolwedge that there are so many fabulous people out there. But it suggests the need for intentionality with friendships and relationships; the opposite of what we did for years with Facebook "friending".

It's okay to catch up with people on different frequencies. Something we need to get better at is *reintroducing ourselves*. We don't need to take offense if someone can't remember our name. When I detect someone can't come up with mine in the moment, I try to graciously just quickly say my name after greeting them ("Hey, Janelle. Paul." or "Hey, Janelle. Paul Berens."), a trick I learned from my own mother. Every once in a while the receiving party turns it into a weird or awkward thing by face-scrunching and saying something about knowing your name, of course, but you can tell that most people appreciate it.

## Why is it so hard to leave?

FOMO


## Not intending to become a hermit

Nor do I want to discourage contact. Just want to do it on my terms; not those of Facebook, Inc.

It's funny I've already been running my own personal experiment to see if I can abstain from Facebook/Instagram for my own personal wellness. I rarely check and don't have the apps on my phone, but the problem is that having active profiles gives the impression one's still available and just (annoyingly) unresponsive (unloving) to posts, messenger pings, etc. So it's time to throw the steering wheel out the window, and give alternate contact info.

I will miss the address book - but I think I just need to build and maintain my own - so please keep me updated with your
- postal address
- email address
- mobile phone
- birthday

How to get in touch w/ me:Events: send me an email or a calendar item to my email.
