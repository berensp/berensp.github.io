<mark_lightgray>I'm hastening to publish this on leap day—because it's a once in a four-year opportunity—but I'll come back later and improve it, because starting TODAY, instead of polishing my writing <i>ad nauseam</i> I'm going to hit [publish] on a post like this in a work-in-progress state, and come back and revise per <a href="https://nickyoder.com/perfectionism/" target="_blank">Nick Yoder's 10-point scale</a>, which I've recently come across and dig.</mark_lightgray>

I attended a talk yesterday on health economics in the US market, and the lecturer trots out this sequence of slides that shows how much the US spends on healthcare (in total and per capita) and then how our life expectancy is mediocre to below average (especially when compared with wealthier peer countries).

![Life expectancy vs. health expenditure (1970-2018)](/assets/images/life-expectancy-vs-health-expenditure-1970-to-2018_1874.png)

These two regrettable facts often come as a pair: that the U.S. has the lowest life expectancy amongst its wealthier peer countries and that it far outspends them on healthcare. And it's not just this professor; the CDC links them as well, and defines the product as "health disadvantage"[^1]\:

[^1]: *[U.S. Health Disadvantage: Causes and Potential Solutions](https://www.cdc.gov/policy/chep/health/index.html)*, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Office of Policy, Performance, and Evaluation; Last Reviewed: January 7, 2022.

> People in the United States have poorer health, more illness, **and shorter lives** than people in other wealthy countries. Americans **pay too much for healthcare** and lack adequate access to healthcare. This is called the U.S. health disadvantage.

But as she spoke I wondered: is this a *causal relationship?* Or what portion of the delta in life expectancy can be explained by our healthcare system and Americans' participation in it versus factors outside of it?

So I had to look into it, and what you find is a complex, multifactorial situation:

![16 causes](/assets/images/16contributors.jpeg)
<span class="muted small">Contribution of 16 causes of death (years) to the U.S. shortfall in life expectancy at birth, men (A) and women (B), 2016.</span>

You can see certain social determinants of health[^2] occupying their own spots on the above graph with, for example, injuries — i.e., **drug overdose**, **firearm-related deaths**, **motor vehicle accidents** — accounting for 43% of American men's life expectancy gap[^3].

[^2]: Rabah Kamal, Cynthia Cox, and Erik Blumenkranz. ["What do we know about social determinants of health in the U.S. and comparable countries?"](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/know-social-determinants-health-u-s-comparable-countries/) *KFF*, November 21, 2017.
[^3]: "Injuries (drug overdose, firearm-related deaths, motor vehicle accidents, homicide), circulatory diseases, and mental disorders/nervous system diseases (including Alzheimer's disease) account for 86% and 67% of American men's and women's life expectancy shortfall, respectively." Jessica Y Ho, [Causes of America's Lagging Life Expectancy: An International Comparative Perspective](https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbab129), *The Journals of Gerontology: Series B*, Volume 77, Issue Supplement_2, May 2022, Pages S117–S126.

But then these and other social determinants of health also feed back into the circulatory, respiratory, and diabetes slices. For example:
- **Obesity** – which then feeds back into cardiovascular disease via diabetes[^4]
- **Sedentary lifestyle** – also increasing likelihood of heart disease
- **Income inequality** (Gini coefficient) – could affect access to care, but this is also linked to education which influences lifestyle choices
- **Environmental factors** – pollution, occupational risks, agricultural methods, climate change, and food contamination

[^4]: "Recent estimates based on macro-level data suggest that obesity might explain as much as two thirds of the US shortfall in male life expectancy and two fifths of the US female life expectancy disadvantage." (Preston SH, Stokes A. [Contribution of Obesity to International Differences in Life Expectancy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3222401/). *Am J Public Health*. November 2011.

So then the question is how much of the gap can be explained by access to care and the efficacy of our healthcare system (in prevention, detection/diagnosis, and treatment) vis-à-vis the healthcare systems of peer countries? It's certainly not zero: one particular 2009 study indicated that somewhere between 0.8 to 1.8 percent of deaths of Americans 25-65 could be attributed to the lack of health insurance[^5].

[^5]: Wilper, Andrew P., Steffie Woolhandler, Karen E. Lasser, Danny McCormick, David H. Bor, and David U. Himmelstein. 2009. ["Health Insurance and Mortality in US Adults."](https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2008.157685) *American Journal of Public Health* 99(12): 2289–2295. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2008.157685.

Mauricio Avendano and Ichiro Kawachi address this in their 2014 article[^6]\:

[^6]: Avendano, Mauricio, and Ichiro Kawachi. "Why do Americans have shorter life expectancy and worse health than do people in other high-income countries?" *Annual Review of Public Health* vol. 35 (2014): 307-25. doi:10.1146/annurev-publhealth-032013-182411

> Nevertheless, regardless of cross-national differences in access to quality medical care, the fact remains that the overwhelming contributors to the incidence of disease (e.g. poor health behaviors) operate largely outside the influence of medical care.

There's much to be desired for the U.S. healthcare system—I, for one, am for single payer (even in the form of continued medicare expansion)—but it seems to have a lot less explanatory power on life expectancy than guns, drugs, and McDonald's.

*Cum hoc ergo propter hoc*.

Happy Leap Day,
