(I'm rushing to publish this on leap day—because it's a once in a four-year opportunity—but I'll come back and improve it, because starting now, instead of polishing writing ad nauseum I'm going to hit `publish` on a post like this in a half-baked state, and come back and revise per Nick Yoder's 10-point scale[^1]\.)

[^1] I discovered [Nick's concept of the 10-point scale](https://nickyoder.com/perfectionism/) (his response to his own perfectionism) where a 0/10 is "title only" and a 10/10 is "complete thought" and nine gradations in between.

I attended a talk yesterday on health economics in the US market, and the lecturer trots out this sequence of slides that shows how much the US spends on healthcare (in total and per capita) and how our life expectancy is mediocre to below average (especially when compared with wealthier peer countries).

We know this oft-repeated refrain[^2] by heart:

[^2]: Shameek Rakshit, Matthew McGough, and Krutika Amin. ["How does U.S. life expectancy compare to other countries?"](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/u-s-life-expectancy-compare-countries/) *KFF*, January 30, 2024.

> The U.S. has the lowest life expectancy among large, wealthy countries while it far outspends its peers on healthcare.

Or on the CDC's website[^3]\:

> People in the United States have poorer health, more illness, and shorter lives than people in other wealthy countries. Americans pay too much for healthcare and lack adequate access to healthcare. This is called the U.S. health disadvantage.

It occurred to me as she was talking that a good portion of the delta in life expectancy may be explained by factors outside our health care system and/or participation in it. And when you look into it, sure enough the evidence seems to point to it being quite lower on the factors[^4].

And so, of course, the US healthcare system plays a significant role in the prevention, detection/diagnosis, and treatment of the circulatory, cardiovascular, and respiratory diseases, for example; but when you come to drug overdoses, firearm-related deaths, homicides, motor vehicle-related deaths[^5]; even if the broader healthcare system can play a role (e.g., mental health, community-based healthcare), there are decidedly other factors at play.

[^5]: "Injuries (drug overdose, firearm-related deaths, motor vehicle accidents, homicide), circulatory diseases, and mental disorders/nervous system diseases (including Alzheimer's disease) account for 86% and 67% of American men's and women's life expectancy shortfall, respectively." ([Ho, S117–S126](https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbab129)).

Also, what we eat and how much is its own factor, but becomes a chronic medical issue in the form of diabetes[^6], heart disease, etc.

[^6]: "Recent estimates based on macro-level data suggest that obesity might explain as much as two thirds of the US shortfall in male life expectancy and two fifths of the US female life expectancy disadvantage." (Preston SH, Stokes A. [Contribution of Obesity to International Differences in Life Expectancy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3222401/). *Am J Public Health*. November 2011.

So then the question is how much of the gap can be explained by access to care, and the efficacy of our healthcare system vis-à-vis the healthcare systems of peer countries? It's certainly not zero: one particular 2009 study indicated that somewhere between 0.8 to 1.8 percent of deaths of Americans 25-65 could be attributed to the lack of health insurance[^7].

[^7]: Wilper, Andrew P., Steffie Woolhandler, Karen E. Lasser, Danny McCormick, David H. Bor, and David U. Himmelstein. 2009. ["Health Insurance and Mortality in US Adults."](https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2008.157685) *American Journal of Public Health* 99(12): 2289–2295. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2008.157685.

Mauricio Avendano and Ichiro Kawachi address this in their 2014 Annual Review of Public Health article[^8]\:

[^8]: Avendano, Mauricio, and Ichiro Kawachi. "Why do Americans have shorter life expectancy and worse health than do people in other high-income countries?" *Annual Review of Public Health* vol. 35 (2014): 307-25. doi:10.1146/annurev-publhealth-032013-182411

> Nevertheless, regardless of cross-national differences in access to quality medical care, the fact remains that the overwhelming contributors to the incidence of disease (e.g. poor health behaviors) operate largely outside the influence of medical care.

And so, yes, there's much to be desired for our healthcare system—I'm for single payor (even in the form of continued medicare expansion)—but it seems to have a lot less explanatory power on life expectancy than guns, drugs, and McDonald's.
