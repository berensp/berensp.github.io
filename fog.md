I can't say I love everything about San Francisco, but the fog is undoubtedly one of its best and most enchanting qualities; rolling through the hills, hanging high in the eucalyptus trees, shrouding views, and [cooling down us runners](https://www.strava.com/activities/5460410709/).

> *Hark now, hear the sailors cry
Smell the sea and feel the sky
Let your soul and spirit fly
Into the mystic
Yeah, when that fog horn blows
I will be coming home
Yeah, when that fog horn blows
I wanna hear it
I don't have to fear it*
