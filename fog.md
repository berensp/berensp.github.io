<p>Fog is the romance of San Francisco: rolling through the hills, hanging high in the eucalyptus trees, shrouding cityscapes, and keeping runners and cyclists nice 'n' cool.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<i>When that fog horn blows
<br>I will be coming home
<br>When that fog horn whistle blows
<br>I wanna hear it
<br>I don't have to fear it</i></blockquote>
