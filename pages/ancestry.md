I am Paul Michael of House Berens, first of his name, Yeobo of Lisa, Father of Matthias and Mariah, Rider of the Fog, Protector of the Em Dash, the Berenzino.

Semi-curious about genealogy and so building out my ancestry on <a href="https://www.WikiTree.com/" target="_blank">WikiTree</a>[^1]. 

[^1]:WikiTree seems to have their stuff together as far as <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Help:About_WikiTree">mission and vision</a>. (I was previously building out a family tree on Geni but it's a little clunky and the profit motive screws things up.)
