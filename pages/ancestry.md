Family history has alway been a fascination, so I'm now trying to build out <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Berens-259" target="_blank">my ancestry on WikiTree</a>[^1] (though I'm a pretty amateur genealogist).

[^1]:WikiTree seems to have their stuff together as far as <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Help:About_WikiTree" target="_blank">mission and vision</a>. (I was previously using <a href="https://www.geni.com" target="_blank">Geni</a> but it's a little clunky and the business model / monetization strategy ultimately undermines the desired network effect.)

<!-- End Family Tree Widget -->

## Goals
1. Get beyond the basics (names, dates, locations) and **into the stories**
2. Flesh out my tree enough to **attract ("bait" in the WikiTree parlance) more participation** to help with #1 ☝
3. Go back far enough to understand **how and when the Berenses made their way from Holland 🇳🇱 to Germany 🇩🇪**
4. Establish degrees of separation from James Joyce, George Bernard Shaw, and W. B. Yeats
