Family history has alway been a fascination, so I'm now trying to build out <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Berens-259" target="_blank">my ancestry on WikiTree</a>[^1] (though I'm a pretty amateur genealogist).

[^1]:WikiTree seems to have their stuff together as far as <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Help:About_WikiTree" target="_blank">mission and vision</a>. (I was previously using <a href="https://www.geni.com" target="_blank">Geni</a> but it's a little clunky and the business model / monetization strategy ultimately undermines the desired network effect.)

## Goals
- Get beyond the basics (names, dates, locations) and into the stories
- Flesh out my tree enough to attract ("bait" in the WikiTree parlance) more participation to help with #1 ☝
- 🇩🇪 side: understand when/how/why the Berenses emigrated from Holland to Germany
- 🇮🇪 side: establish degrees of separation from James Joyce, George Bernard Shaw, and W. B. Yeats

## Running list of insights
- **Life used to be a lot harder.** My <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Miessner-9" target="_blank">paternal grandmother</a> was born in Montana because her parents took an enticing homestead offer and relocated from Wisconsin. It turned out they were duped by the government and the railroad: the soil was crap/untillable. Facing possible starvation they escaped back to Wisconsin with the help of the Lutheran Church, which is why, as I understand it, my great-grandparents didn't take kindly to it when my grandmother later converted to [Catholicism](/catholic/) (how could you turn your back on the institution that [literally] saved us?). There's a book called [*Bad Land*](/book-reviews/bad-land/) which describes the experience of my grandmother's family and that of many of their unfortunate neighbors in that very inhospitable region of Montana.
