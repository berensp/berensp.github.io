Family history has alway been a fascination, so I'm now trying to build out <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Berens-259" target="_blank">my ancestry on WikiTree</a>[^1] (though I'm a pretty amateur genealogist).

[^1]:WikiTree seems to have their stuff together as far as <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Help:About_WikiTree" target="_blank">mission and vision</a>. (I was previously using <a href="https://www.geni.com" target="_blank">Geni</a> but it's a little clunky and the business model / monetization strategy ultimately undermines the desired network effect.)

## Goals
- Get beyond the basics (names, dates, locations) and into the stories
- Flesh out my tree enough to attract ("bait" in the WikiTree parlance) more participation to help with #1 ☝
- 🇩🇪 side-specific goal: Go back far enough to understand how/when the Berenses emigrated from Holland to Germany
- 🇮🇪 side-specific goal: Establish degrees of separation from James Joyce, George Bernard Shaw, and W. B. Yeats

## Running list of insights
- Life used to be a lot harder. My paternal grandmother (Helen) was born in Montana because her parents took an enticing homestead offer and relocated from Wisconsin. It turned out they were duped by the government and the railroad: the soil was crap. They escaped back to Wisconsin before they starved with the help of the Lutheran Church, which is why, as I understand it, my great-grandparents didn't take kindly to it when my grandmother later converted to Catholicism (how could you turn your back on the institution that [literally] saved us?). There's a book called *Bad Land* which describes the experience of my grandmother's family and that of their unfortunate neighbors, which I've got [among my favorites](/books/).
