My most challenging [ride](/cycling/) to date. King Ridge Road is a monster climb and then just when you think this century is over, hier kommt Coleman Valley at Mile ~75. But it's got everything: redwood forests, foggy mountain pastures, coastal vistas. Alas, I wince at it becoming something of a big commercial operation (even if under the guise of charity), but it was too good to be kept a secret.
