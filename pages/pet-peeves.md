Only a total *kvetch* would list his pet peeves, so I'll just frame it as me being a bit particular about certain things...
- Mechanical pencils – it's complete folly how they require the perfect amount of force at the perfect angle for the graphite not to snap
- Mealy apples – self-explanatory
- Speed bumps – at least in SF a NIMBY thing
- Brushing your teeth in a workplace restroom
- Whistling – i.e., impinging on our right to peaceful enjoyment of life
- Rules of the road:
	- Walking on the left
	- Able-bodied people ambling across crosswalks while others are waiting
	- Cyclists blowing through intersections
	- Bicyclists riding on sidewalks
- People with mediocre English skills but who fancy themselves grammarians and offer edits
- WinZip
- Things people say:
	- Introducing oneself to a group with "For those who don't know me…" if you’re not at least a C-list celebrity
	- "...and this is something I like to call [generic word / word someone else coined]."
