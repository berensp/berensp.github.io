Only a total kvetch would promulgate his pet peeves...so...let's get into it:
- Introducing oneself to a group with "For those who don't know me…" if you're not at least a C-list celebrity
- Mechanical pencils
- People with mediocre English skills who fancy themselves grammarians offering their edits
- Rules of the road violations
	- Bicyclists: blowing through intersections, riding on sidewalks
	- Pedestrians: walking on the left, able-bodied people ambling across crosswalks, making others wait
- Speed bumps – a NIMBY thing (at least in SF)
- Whistling
- WinZip®
