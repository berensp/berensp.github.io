Only a total kvetch would promulgate his pet peeves, so just think of it as me being a bit particular about certain things...
- Brushing your teeth in a workplace restroom
- Mealy apples – self-explanatory
- Mechanical pencils – it's complete folly how the graphite demands the perfect amount of force at the perfect angle to not snap
- People with mediocre English skills but who fancy themselves grammarians offering their edits
- Rules of the road:
	- Walking on the left
	- Able-bodied people ambling across crosswalks while others are waiting
	- Cyclists blowing through intersections
	- Bicyclists riding on sidewalks
- Speed bumps – a NIMBY thing (at least in SF)
- Things people say:
	- Introducing oneself to a group with "For those who don't know me…" if you’re not at least a C-list celebrity
	- "...and this is something I like to call [generic word / word someone else coined]."
- Whistling – i.e., impinging on our right to peaceful enjoyment of life
- WinZip
