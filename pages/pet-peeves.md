Only a *kvetch* would list his pet peeves, but I'll just say that I'm particular about certain things...
- Mechanical pencils (it's complete folly how one needs to apply the perfect amount of force at the perfect angle to not break the graphite)
- Mealy apples
- Speed bumps
- Brushing your teeth at a workplace bathroom
- Whistling (i.e., impinging on your right to peaceful enjoyment of life)
- Rules of the road:
	- Failing to observe walk-on-the-right etiquette
	- Able-bodied people ambling—being to dignified to hustle—across crosswalks, making others wait for you.
	- Cyclists blowing through intersections
	- Bicyclists riding on sidewalks
- Changing/tweaking/effing with branding/branded elements
- WinZip
- Things people say:
	- Introducing oneself to a group with "For those who don't know me…" if you’re not at least a C-list celebrity
	- "...and this is something I like to call [generic word / word someone else coined]."
