- **Soteriology / Teleology:** (See [notes on Catholicism](/catholic)
- **Epistemology:**
	- It's hard to get smarter without reading.
	- As a society we may be increasing our knowledge base and growing technologically, but that's not necessarily translating to *wisdom*.
- **Technology:** it's great—I'm very much an enthusiast—but it ain't gonna save us
- **History:**
	- Preserves and reminds us of useful ideas that may be as good/better than today's thinking
	- Useful in helping us realize how good/easy we've got it
- **Astrobiology:** until I see some new evidence, I'm in the *Silentium universi* camp.

- **Personal finance:** financial benefit != economic benefit (e.g., housing rent vs. buy calculation)
