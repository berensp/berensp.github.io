> *"[Great music][^1] invigorates our best faculties and...inspires love in the highest part of the soul."* (â€”Iris Murdoch)

[^1]:In actuality she said "great art" or "good art", and so I'm taking some license with her quote.

Lots to include in this page: music created, musical opinions, musical associations, musical memories, etc.

## My Music Odyssey

Music is in my soul by nature and nurture, thanks firstly to my mother who herself was inspired by her Grandma Kate:

My mom took up piano at a young age but discovered she both loved it and had exceptional talent early on: playing all the weddings and funerals at her church by the fourth grade, did college on a full ride music scholarship, joined the USO Tour, invited on the Lance Welk Show, and the list goes on. Instead of being a professional musician on the Lawrence Welk Showâ€”she declinedâ€”she married my dad and taught music to grade school students and also played at our church, [St. Cecilia's](https://stceciliaspm.org/), the patroness of music. So live piano music was a fixture in our home, and I grew up singing in church just one pew behind Mom. I started my own piano lessons in kindergarten, but Mom's policy was if you weren't demonstating your own motivation and love for piano by sixth grade (?), she wasn't going to force it. And so I regrettably quit at that first opportunity.

Then in the summer between my freshman and sophomore years of high school, my family was in northern Wisconin on vacation and my mom was strumming an old nylon string guitar she had. "Mom, I didn't know you played guitar," I said incredulously.

"Well, I had to demonstrate proficiency in three instruments for the USO Tour, so guitar ended up being one of my three, but I really only know a few chords... Come here; this song's easy..." And she proceeded to show me the 'D', 'A7', and 'G' chords for the tune she was playing *Blowin' in the Wind)*. From I was hooked. Mom had a book of folk songs from the Old Town School of Music and I went through nearly every song, forcing my fingers to make shapes they decidedly did not want to make.

## Music Creation

Folk and classical piano music were omnipresent in our household, as you'd expect when your mother is my mother: grade school music teacher
