When I don't have time for a [ride](/cycling/)â€”which is nearly always nowadasâ€”there aren't many aerobic options as easy and endorphin-boosting as running. Given the choice I opt for the trail; not just to be good to these patellofemoral arthralgia-disposed knees, but also to be able to take in some beautiful scenery whilst [catching up on podcasts](/assets/audio/pmb_podcasts_opml_20240318.xml) or [just think](/solvitur-currendo.html).
