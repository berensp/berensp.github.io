*Why on earth did you click that link?* Well, as long as you're here, I may as well give you my diapering POV:
- **Product Portfolio.** WaterWipes®, Boudreaux's Butt Paste®, Huggies®, Dekor™ diaper pail—that's in order of operations; not in order of rating.
- **Technique.** Snug around the waist, but not too tight. As comfortable as it is, I try to avoid changing on the bed or any elevated surface: you unnecessarily introduce the possibility of a fall.
- **In-flight.** Save a toy/trinket for your flights so that when you have to use the claustrophobic airplane bathroom changing table you've got something novel to distract your little one and avoid—or at least delay the start of—the freak-out. Even so, move with urgency; you're operating with limited time.
- **DT = QT.** Believe it or not, diaper time is good 1:1 quality time with your child (eye contact, trust-building, etc.)...unless, of course, it's a blow-out and then it's less *quality time* and more *business time*.
