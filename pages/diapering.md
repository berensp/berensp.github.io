Why on earth did you click that link?  
What did you expect to see here?  
Well, as long as you're here, I guess I may as well give you my diapering POV:
- **Technique.** Front to back. Not too tight; just tight enough
- **In-flight.** Save a toy/trinket for your flights so that when you have to use the claustrophobic airplane bathroom changing table you've got something novel to distract from/delay the freak-out. Even so, move with urgency; the you have limited time. 
- **Expert Product Portfolio.** WaterWipes®, Boudreaux's Butt Paste®, Huggies®, Dekor Plus Hands Free Diaper Pail—that's in order of operations; not in order of rating.
- **DT = QT.** Diaper time is good 1:1 quality time with your child (eye contact, chance to take care of them)...unless, of course, it's a blow-out and then it's less *quality time* and more *business time*.
