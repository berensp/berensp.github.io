Why on earth did you click that link?
What did you expect to see here?
Well, as long as you're here, I guess I may as well give you my diapering POV:
- Not too tight; just tight enough
- Front to back
- Save a toy/trinket for your flights so that when you have to use the claustrophobic airplane bathroom changing table you've got something novel to distract from/delay the freak-out. Even so, move with urgency; you'll have limited time. 
- Our diaper product portfolio:
	- Boudreaux's Butt Paste®
	- Dekor Plus Hands Free Diaper Pail
	- WaterWipes
	- Huggies®
- Seriously, though, diaper time is good quality time...unless, of course, it's one of those explosive ones and then it's less quality time and more business time.
