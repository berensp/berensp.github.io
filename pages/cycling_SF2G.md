SF2G = San Francisco to Google (i.e. riding from SF to Peninsula and South Bay-lying office locations). I've done this so many times that I know it by heart...which is useful because there are so many little (unmarked) turns[^1]. As far as a ride itself, it's pretty industrial along the 101, so it doesn't win the loveliness award, but I love getting up and out early and combining the commute with a workout, and always fun to ride with others through [SF2G](https://sf2g.com/about.html) which provides an email forum for people to "call rides" (which route, from which coffee shop, at what time, and at what pace). Then in the afternoon let Caltrain drive you back up.

[^1] Unless we're talking about [bike to work day](https://bayareabiketowork.com/) in which case there are myriad markers thanks to hard-working volunteers.
