*"The difficulty explaining why I am Catholic is that there are ten thousand reasons all amounting to one reason: that Catholicism is true."* (â€”G.K. Chesterton, *Twelve Modern Apostles and Their Creeds*, 1926)

## The Best Arguments for God's Existence
- **Cosmic / the finely-tuned universe**
- **Of Contingency**
- **Of Desire.** "If there is a desire in my heart which corresponds to nothing in this world, perhaps I am made for another world?"
- **Of Morality.** We intuit moral laws, and laws require a lawgiver.

## The Best Arguments for the Christian God / Jesus Christ
- **Liar / Lunatic / Lord**
- **Miracles / apparitions / near-death experience accounts**
- **The longevity of the Church.** The idea that the Church, run by broken, sinful, misguided humans has outlasted the Roman Empire by one and a half millenia is incredible. It should've been run aground long ago. It's almost as if it's being guided by an invisible hand.

## Best Arguments Against God / The Faith
- **Theodicy.** a.k.a. "The Problem of Evil" (e.g., "How could a good God allow bone cancer in a two-year-old child?). 
- **Faith vs. Reason / Faith vs. Science.** This is a falsely-aporetic conflict.
- **Hypocriticism.**
