*"The difficulty explaining why I am Catholic is that there are ten thousand reasons all amounting to one reason: that Catholicism is true."* (â€”G.K. Chesterton, *Twelve Modern Apostles and Their Creeds*, 1926)

## The Best Arguments for God's Existence
- **Aquinas' Argument from Motion.** *(a.k.a. Argument of the Unmoved Mover).* Each change has a cause, but an infinite regress is impossible, and so there must be a first mover.
- **The Finely-tuned Universe.**[^1]
	- "The Penrose Number" - The odds of the universe coming into existence in a way that would develop and support life (i.e. of our universe's exceedingly low entropy [high order]) was calculated to be 1 / (10^10^123).
	- The Cosmological Constant - universe expanding at precisely the right rate (and not go into a black hole and collapse nor expand too fast so that everything becomes too dispersed to allow for the creation of protons, neutrons, Hydrogen, and any element heavier the Hydrogen) = 1 / (10^10^120)
- **Argument from Desire.** "If there is a desire in my heart which corresponds to nothing in this world, perhaps I am made for another world?" [Perhaps best articulated by U2](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=TAxs0qIBw0g&si=t6cmLQhnwojXVny3).
- **Argument from Morality.** We intuit moral laws, and laws require a lawgiver.

## The Best Arguments for the Christian God / Jesus Christ

- **Miracles / Apparitions / Near-death Experiences**. There are certainly bogus accounts, people suffering psychoses or delusions, or disingenuous characters in search of attention/fame[^1]; but in my estimation it's a small percentage and doesn't explain away all accounts.
- **The longevity of the Church.** The idea that the Church, run by broken, sinful, misguided humans has outlasted the Roman Empire by one and a half millenia is incredible. It should've been run aground long ago. It's almost as if it's being guided by an invisible hand.
- **C.S. Lewis' "Liar, Lunatic, Lord" Paradigm.** I might put the entire case as presented in *Mere Christianity* but when you consider all of the evidence (empty tomb, early disciples going to their deaths for it, etc.) and layer on top of it the language used by Christ, he didn't leave open the possibility that he was just a "good rabbi who was bringing a message of peace and forgiveness to the world" as his claims and assertions would have been blasphemy either knowingly (liar) or unknowingly (lunatic).

[^1]: Although I'd argue most people don't have the Broadway-level acting ability to fool the masses.

## Best Arguments Against God / The Faith
- **Theodicy.** a.k.a. "The Problem of Evil" (e.g., "How could a good God allow bone cancer in a two-year-old child?). 
- **Faith vs. Reason / Faith vs. Science.** This is a falsely-aporetic conflict.
- **Hypocriticism.**
