*"When that fog horn blows / You know I will be coming home / Yeah, when that fog horn whistle blows / I gotta hear it / I don't have to fear it."* (â€”Van Morrison)

Fog is the charm of [San Francisco](/sf/): rolling through the hills, hanging high in the eucalyptus trees, shrouding cityscapes, and keeping it nice 'n' cool for [running](/run/) and [cycling](/cycling/).
