[^1]: As an [INTP](/personality.html), I prize the direct speak—maybe not quite to the level of adopting [Crocker's Rules](http://sl4.org/crocker.html), but hopefully one day.

[^2]: Here I mean Aristotle's concept (εὐτραπελία) as the virtuous mean in humor: the capacity for witty, gracious conversation characterized by playfulness and pleasantness, coupled with the discernment to judge what is appropriate to the occasion. This stands opposed to the Pauline use of the term, where it denotes coarse or vulgar jesting unbecoming to Christians.
