I run...though I wouldn't call myself a *runner* in the sense that I'm not particularly accomplished or very fast.

I used to not be a big fan of it. Plodding along. Periodically battling an injury whether it be shin splints or patellofemoral arthralgia or plantar fasciitis.

But when I'm relatively healthy, there's nothing so time efficient and easy and cheap (with endorphin hit) as running from your front door.

I try to maximize the trail-to-asphalt ratioâ€”not only for the knees and but was to be able to take in some beautiful sceneryâ€”

Currently I oscillate between a [Twin Peaks Mt. Sutro](/twin-peaks-mt-sutro/) loop and a [7th Ave GGP Moraga Steps](/ggp-moraga-steps/).

When we lived in Laurel Heights a loop through the Presidio was my default.

And years in Potrero Hill typically had me running the Embarcadero, either to the Ferry Building and back; else to the Bay & Fillmore and #22 bus back.
