Let's face it: there aren't many exercise options as time efficient, cheap, and endorphin-rich as running. Given the choice I opt for the trail; not just to be good to these patellofemoral arthralgia-disposed knees, but also to be able to take in some beautiful scenery.

## Current routes
- [Twin Peaks Mt. Sutro](/twin-peaks-mt-sutro/)
- [7th Ave GGP Moraga Steps](/ggp-moraga-steps/)

## Old favorites
- Laurel Heights era: a loop through the Presidio (Ecology Trail)
- Potrero Hill era: Embarcadero; either to the Ferry Building and back, else to the Bay & Fillmore and #22 bus back.
