The "hate side" of my love-hate with running has something to do with occasional *patellofemoral arthralgia* and *plantar fasciitis*, whereas the "love side" seems to correspond with being in okay-enough shape to achieve some degree of "runner's high" and/or being able to run beautiful routes.

Currently I oscillate between a [Twin Peaks Mt. Sutro](/twin-peaks-mt-sutro/) loop and a [7th Ave GGP Moraga Steps](/ggp-moraga-steps/).

When we lived in Laurel Hts. this was my default.

And years in Potrero Hill typically had me running the Embarcadero, either to the Ferry Building and back; else to the Bay & Fillmore and #22 bus back.
