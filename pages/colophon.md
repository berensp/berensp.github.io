This site is hosted on [GitHub Pages and built with Jekyll using Clio](/this-site), a template and theme designed by Dan Romero. And you know it's really me because it's verified on <a href="https://keybase.io/berens" target="_blank">Keybase</a> and <a href="https://nf.td/pmb" target="_blank">NF.TD</a>. So put that in your pipe.

Imprinted at San Francisco, California
