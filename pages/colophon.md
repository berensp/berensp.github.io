*"Explicit iste liber, scriptor sit crimine liber, Christus scriptorem custodiat ac det honorem."*[^1]

[^1]:*Here ends this book. May the scribe be free from reproach. May Christ protect the scribe and give him honor.* (This notes the completion of the copy of the Bodleian MS. 264 of the *Roman d'Alexandre* on the 18th of December 1338.)
