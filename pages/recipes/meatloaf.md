## Meatloaf ingredients
- 1 lb. ground turkey or ground beef
- ½ cup crushed buttery round crackers
- ⅓ cup milk
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 1 egg
- 1 (heaping) tsp. minced garlic
- 1 tsp. salt
- ¼ tsp. ground black pepper

## Topping
- ⅓ cup ketchup
- 2 tbsp brown sugar
- 1 tbsp. worcestershire sauce

## Instructions
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
- Mix ground turkey, crushed crackers, milk, onion, egg, garlic, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Shape mixture into a loaf and place on the prepared baking sheet with wax paper.
- Mix ketchup, brown sugar, and Worcestershire sauce in a separate bowl; set aside.
- Bake meatloaf in preheated oven for 30 minutes; remove from the oven and drain off liquids. Top meatloaf with ketchup topping.
- Return loaf to the oven and continue baking until no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes more; an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).
