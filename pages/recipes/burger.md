@Dad always used the Worcestershire sauce, so I don't skip it. 1½ lb. recipe for four patties.

## Ingredients
- 1 ½ pounds 80% lean 20% fat ground beef or ground chuck
- 1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 ½ tsp seasoning salt
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- cheese slices
- hamburger buns
- other toppings: lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, ketchup, mustard, mayo, etc.

## Instructions
- Preheat the grill to 375 degrees F (medium-high).
- Sprinkle ingredients evenly across beef. Mix until they are just combined.
- Divide mixture into fourths → make patties →
- Make indentation in the middle to prevent the bulging!
- Cook 4-5 minutes per side. (You get one flip and one flip only.)
