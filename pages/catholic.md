title: Why I'm Catholic

*"The difficulty explaining why I am Catholic is that there are ten thousand reasons all amounting to one reason: that Catholicism is [true](/apologia/)."* (—G.K. Chesterton, *Twelve Modern Apostles and Their Creeds*, 1926)

## TL;DR: The Inimitability of Catholicism
1. **Sacramentality.** Grace breaking through the veil: Baptism, Penance, Eucharist.
2. **Historical Continuity.** From the Apostles through antiquity to the Middle Ages to the modern period; through Her victories and saints, Her failures and sinners; the Church has endured for two millenia (against all odds).[^1]
3. **Doctrinal Steadfastness.** There are exceptions, but on the whole, the Church isn't trying to win a popularity contest, and I quite respect this.

[^1]: It's a reason to love Catholicism ([Mt 16:18](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/matthew/16?18)), but also good evidence for it being guided by the H.S. as every other institution and empire has fallen over the centuries.

## Growin' Up
The first and simplest answer of why I'm Catholic is that I was "brought up" in the Faith, which I'm proud of *(fidei donum)* but also a touch self-conscious about—or shall I say I'm defensive against the tacit assumption that faith is a mere function of upbringing and where the Fates had you be born[^2]. I'd characterize this as a genetic fallacy. It also holds less water as society secularizes and it's not so fashionable to practice Catholicism. But, as I say, it was a gift: Mass every Sunday with Mom at the piano, leading the congregation in sung prayer, as Dad ensured we didn't screw around and participated (sang). They were carrying a tradition passed down from their parents and so on. This is more than my immediate family: four grandparents[^3] (one a convert), 19 biological aunts and uncles, family friends, et al. Kindergarten through third grade, and then eighth through twelfth grades were Catholic schooling, and while it was maybe catechetically unremarkable, I was surrounded by many people living out their faith to the best of their ability (which carries a lot of weight).
 
[^2]: This is frequently hauled out by the atheists (e.g., "How thoughtful of God to arrange matters so that, wherever you happen to be born, your local religion turns out to be the true one" —Richard Dawkins).
[^3]: Maybe for another post, but there's a story to be told on how my maternal grandmother's tireless efforts can be credited with cultivating the faith of the next generations.

## Claiming it
My formation in Christianity and Catholicism was multi-faceted with many lovely people playing parts, but it also lacked some rigor—for which I take full responsibility as I was at wonderful schools and surrounded by marvelous teachers. High school was diocesan, and so it was my Uncle John who turned me on to the Jesuits (he having been formed in the tradition for the better part of a decade before deciding to exit). And so I chose Boston College for college, its (Jesuit) Catholicity no small factor, and once there my faith indeed expanded...in the classroom certainly (e.g., with [Fr. Michael Himes](/frhimes.html/)), through various retreats and activities, but also through many late-night discussions and debates with clever friends[^4]. Kairos VIII impacted me enough that I joined the leadership team of a subsequent one; but theologically it only went ankle-deep, and so it demanded I take the next step on my own, which I failed to do...at least at that time. In my mid-20s I did deviate from the Faith when Protestantism directly challenged it and I lacked the theological foundations to overcome. However that detour ended up being profitable to my faith overall, and ultimately, I appreciated the shake because it sent me on a path of greater inquiry. I became hungry for theology and several texts had an oversized influence on me, *Seven Storey Mountain* by Thomas Merton being among the most important. Later the Word on Fire institute and EWTN were very helpful to my formation and growth.

## Love & Marriage
I married "up" in many senses, but faith was certainly one: Lisa's itself but also that of her family: earnest, natural, bold, everpresent—possibly a gift from the Korean martyrs. We met in the contemporary choir of St. Dominic's, me a guitarist and vocalist; she a pianist. Faith occupied an important part of our relationship (e.g., weekly Lectio Divina with friends), and it evenutally led us to Star of the Sea which has been a solid spiritual home for the past several years.
