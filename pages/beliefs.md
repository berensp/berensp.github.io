- Theologically, teleologically, soteriologically, I'm [puro Católico](/catholic)
- It's hard to get smarter without [reading](/books/)
- I'm a tech *enthusiast,* but not a tech *solutionist* (i.e. it ain't gonna save us) (see Technology section in [systems](/systems/))
- It's ambitious, but we should work toward a decentralized (human) web before the AI overlords make it impossible (see [Farcaster post](/farcaster.html) and [*Read Write Own* post](/read-write-own))
- Apologies to the ufologists, but my money is on us being alone *(Silentium universi)*

- Able-bodied pedestrians that amble across crosswalks, making people wait for them, should be jailed immediately (maybe parole) 
- Whistling impinges on others' freedom
- When introducing oneself to a group, no need to lead with "for those who don't know me…"
- Before offering your edits, have a moment of cool reflection on your English skills
- Bicyclists: if it's too much work to stop at intersections, you probably need to get in shape
- Speed bumps can be useful but are also a NIMBY thing
- Mechanical pencils are a false economy
