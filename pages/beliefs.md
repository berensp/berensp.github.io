- Theologically, teleologically, soteriologically, I'm [puro Católico](/catholic)
- I'm a tech *enthusiast,* but not a tech *solutionist* (i.e. it ain't gonna save us) (see Technology section in [systems](/systems/).
- It's ambitious, but we should work toward a decentralized (human) web before the AI overlords make it impossible (see [Farcaster post](/farcaster.html) and [*Read Write Own* post](/read-write-own))
- We are probably alone in the universe *([Silentium universi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox))*

## *Kvetchy* pet peeves masquerading as beliefs
- When introducing oneself to a group, people who aren't at least a C-list celebrities shouldn't lead with "for those who don't know me…"; just introduce yourself
- Before offering your edits, have a moment of cool reflection on your English skills and if they're up to par
- Bicyclists: if it's too much work to stop at intersections, you probably need to get in shape
- Whistling impinges on others' freedom
- Mechanical pencils should be banned; traditional pencils only
- Able-bodied pedestrians that amble across crosswalks should be jailed immediately (maybe parole) 
- Speed bumps can be useful but are also a NIMBY thing
