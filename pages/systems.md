## Epistemology
- I'm a [Constructivist](/learning/), but also believe it's hard to get smarter without [reading](/books/) 
- Literacy Threshold Theory – meaningful knowledge acquisition requires reaching certain threshold levels of literacy[^1]
- We've got an ever-widening knowledge-wisdom gap
- Be ever vigilant of [fallacies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies) (e.g., *argumentum ad populum)*
- Replication crisis

## History/Civilization
- Beware of discarding things just because they're old ([Cut flowers theory](/cut-flowers), [Chesterton's Fence](https://fs.blog/chestertons-fence/), [Lindy Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect)).

## Organization
- [Pournelle's Iron Law of Bureaucracy](https://gordonbrander.com/pattern/pournelles-iron-law-of-bureaucracy/)
