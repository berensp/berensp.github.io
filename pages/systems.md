A running list of useful frameworks, mental models, heuristics, and first principles:

## Decision-making / Metrics
- [Abilene Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abilene_paradox)
- [Bounded Rationality](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bounded-rationality/)
- [Goodhart's Law](https://gordonbrander.com/pattern/goodharts-law/)
- [Hats, Haircuts, Tattoos](https://x.com/JamesClear/status/1753816430422683712)
- [Secretary problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem)
- [Watermelon Effect](https://www.happysignals.com/blog/watermelon-effect)

## Economics
- Disposition Effect – Investors' tendency to sell winning investments too early while holding losing investments too long
- Sunk Cost Fallacy – Continuing an endeavor due to past investment despite irrationality
- Opportunity Cost – The loss of potential gain from alternatives when one option is chosen
- Comparative Advantage (Ricardo) – Economic benefit from specialization even when one party has absolute advantage
- Time Preference Theory – How present consumption is valued versus future consumption
- Tragedy of the Commons – How individual rational behavior leads to depleting shared resources
- Moral Hazard – When parties take risks because they don't bear the full costs
- Principal-Agent Problem – Conflicts of interest when someone acts on another's behalf
- Cantillon Effect – How money creation benefits those closest to the source
- Gresham's Law – "Bad money drives out good" in currency circulation

## Epistemology
- I'm a [Constructivist](/learning/), but also believe it's hard to get smarter without [reading](/books/) 
- Literacy Threshold Theory – meaningful knowledge acquisition requires reaching certain threshold levels of literacy[^1].
- We've got a growing knowledge-wisdom gap. (E.F. Schumacher's "Small is Beautiful")
- Be ever vigilant of [fallacies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies) (e.g., *argumentum ad populum)*.

## History/Civilization
- Beware of discarding things just because they're old ([Cut flowers theory](/cut-flowers.html), [Chesterton's Fence](https://fs.blog/chestertons-fence/), [Lindy Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect)).
- [Tytler's Cycle](https://thinkingwest.com/2022/11/16/tytlers-cycle-of-civilizations/) – are we headed toward bondage? (see [Safetyism post](/safetyism/))
- [Tainter's Collapse of Complex Societies](https://philosophicaldisquisitions.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-collapse-of-complex-societies_1.html)

## Organization
- [Pournelle's Iron Law of Bureaucracy](https://gordonbrander.com/pattern/pournelles-iron-law-of-bureaucracy/)
- [Conway's Law](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/teamwork/what-is-conways-law-acmi)

## Psychology/Behavior 
- Cognitive biases ([Availability Heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic), etc.) (See [Safetyism post](/safetyism/))
- Status/Signaling (Veblen goods, stated vs. revealed preferences)
- Personal Utility Function and Financial Calculation Gap (gap between monetary returns and full economic utility) (e.g., housing rent vs. buy calculation)

## Social Dynamics 
- Network effects and Dunbar's Number (see [FB post](/fb))
- Game theory concepts (Prisoner's Dilemma, coordination problems)
- Nassim Taleb's Skin in the Game principle

## Technology
- I'm a tech enthusiast, but not a tech solutionist (i.e. it ain't gonna save us): Jevons Paradox, Ellul Principle, Collingridge Dilemma, [Heidegger's Critique of Tech](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/understanding-heidegger-on-technology), Neil Postman's Technopoly.
- It's ambitious, but we should work toward a decentralized web (see [Farcaster post](/farcaster.html) and [*Read Write Own* post](/books/read-write-own/))

## Miscellanea
- **Astrobiology:** [*Silentium universi*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox)
- **Soteriology / Teleology:** (See [Catholicism post](/catholic))
