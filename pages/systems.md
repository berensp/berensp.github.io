My running list of frameworks, mental models, heuristics, and first principles I find interesting/useful:

## Decision-making / Metrics
- [Abilene Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abilene_paradox)
- [Bounded Rationality](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bounded-rationality/)
- [Goodhart's Law](https://gordonbrander.com/pattern/goodharts-law/)
- [Secretary problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem)
- [Watermelon Effect](https://www.happysignals.com/blog/watermelon-effect)
- **Limited info:** Bezos' 70% Rule, [Hats, Haircuts, Tattoos](https://x.com/JamesClear/status/1753816430422683712), Lasers and Compasses[^1]

[^1]: h/t to Zack Smith for this one.

## Economics
- Behavorial Finance > Efficient Market Hypothesis
- Disposition Effect
- Sunk Cost Fallacy
- Opportunity Cost
- Comparative Advantage (Ricardo)
- Time Preference Theory
- Tragedy of the Commons
- Moral Hazard
- Principal-Agent Problem
- E.F. Schumacher's "Small is Beautiful"
- Inequality frameworks:
	- Cantillon Effect
	- The "Great Decoupling" (Brynjolfsson/McAfee)
	- "Hollowing out" hypothesis (Autor)
	- Piketty's r > g formula
	- Skill-biased technological change (SBTC)

## Epistemology
- Literacy Threshold Theory[^1]
- We've got an ever-widening knowledge-wisdom gap
- Be ever vigilant of [fallacies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies) (e.g., *argumentum ad populum)*
- Replication crisis

[^1]: Meaningful knowledge acquisition requires reaching certain threshold levels of literacy. The answer to why the average bloke can't pick up and bang through *Infinite Jest*—I'm including myself here. (Also the Matthew Effect.)

## History/Civilization
- Beware of discarding things just because they're old ([Cut flowers theory](/cut-flowers), [Chesterton's Fence](https://fs.blog/chestertons-fence/), [Lindy Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect)).
- [Tytler's Cycle](https://thinkingwest.com/2022/11/16/tytlers-cycle-of-civilizations/) – are we headed toward bondage? (see [Safetyism post](/safetyism))
- [Tainter's Collapse of Complex Societies](https://philosophicaldisquisitions.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-collapse-of-complex-societies_1.html)

## Organization
- [Pournelle's Iron Law of Bureaucracy](https://gordonbrander.com/pattern/pournelles-iron-law-of-bureaucracy/)
- Value Capture v. Value Creation Loop – when firms/orgs can extract high margins there is reduced pressure to allocate resources efficiently (e.g., bloat in US four-year universities as described in my [Liberal Arts post](/liberal-arts))
- [Conway's Law](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/teamwork/what-is-conways-law-acmi)

## Problem-solving
- Kidlin's Law

## Psychology/Behavior 
- Cognitive biases ([Availability Heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic), etc.) (See [Safetyism post](/safetyism))
- Status/Signaling (Veblen goods, stated vs. revealed preferences)
- Personal Utility Function and Financial Calculation Gap (gap between monetary returns and full economic utility) (e.g., housing rent vs. buy calculation)
- Enantiodromia (referenced in [Orthopraxy post](/orthopraxy.html))

## Social Dynamics 
- Network effects and Dunbar's Number (see [FB post](/fb))
- Game theory concepts (Prisoner's Dilemma, coordination problems)
- Nassim Taleb's Skin in the Game principle

## Technology
- Jevons Paradox
- Ellul Principle
- Collingridge Dilemma
- [Heidegger's Critique of Tech](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/understanding-heidegger-on-technology)

## Miscellanea
