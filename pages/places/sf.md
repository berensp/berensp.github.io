SF has been home for the last <span id="TimeinSF"></span>.

It's tragically broken—*hic manebimus optime?*—due to a convergence of factors, but safe to say it's mostly due to the city's political structure and dynamics.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

I concur with Om Malik:

> In San Francisco, technologies, new ideas, and people collide randomly in the oddest of places, at the oddest of times. Much of this has to do with the density of techies. In a way, that in itself is a self-fulling [sic] destiny.

Example from my own life: the [family organizer app](https://kukiniapp.com/) we rely upon was built by our former downstairs neighbor.
