SF has been home for the last <span id="TimeinSF"></span>. I simultaneously appreciate its beauty and <a href="/fog">fog</a> and distinctiveness, and lament its problems[^1][^2][^3][^4].

## A few favourites/recos for visitors[^5]:
- **Hikes/walks/runs:** Lands End Trail, Twin Peaks, Angel Island, [Presidio-Ecology Trail Loop‚Ñ¢](/presidio/)
- **Points of interest:** Golden Gate Bridge, Chinatown, Chrissy Field, Ferry Building[^6], City Lights book store
- **Activities:** ride the Hyde Street cablecar; bicycle over the bridge to Sausalito and ferry back, stroll up Fillmore Street, motor down the truly-windiest street (Vermont; not Lombard!)
- **Restaurants:** Frascati (üçù), Plow (ü•û), Pancho Villa (üåØ), Pizzetta 211 (üçï). 
- **Coffeehouses:** Farley's, Sightglass, Sextant Coffee Roasters, Ritual Roasters.
	- **Restaurant coffee:** Park Tavern (as recently as 2015!).
- **Bars:** The Social Study, Third Rail, Southern Pacific Brewing, Standard Deviant.
- **Live Music Venues:** Bottom of the Hill, The Chapel, The Fillmore, Cafe Du Nord, The Independent, The Greek Theater (Berkeley)
