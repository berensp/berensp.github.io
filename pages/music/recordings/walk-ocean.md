## Lyrics
We spotted the ocean<br>
At the head of the trail<br>
Where are we goin?<br>
So far away<br>
And somebody told me<br>
This is the place<br>
Where every thing's better<br>
And every thing's safe<br>

Walk on the ocean<br>
Step on the stones<br>
Flesh becomes water<br>
Wood becomes bone

Half an hour later<br>
We packed up our things<br>
We said we'd send letters<br>
And all of those little things<br>
They knew we were lying<br>
They smiled just the same<br>
And it seemed they'd already<br>
Forgotten we'd came<br>

Walk on the ocean<br>
Step on the stones<br>
Flesh becomes water<br>
Wood becomes bone<br>

Back at the homestead<br>
Where the air makes you choke<br>
People don't know you<br>
And trust is a joke<br>
Don't even have pictures<br>
Just memories to hold<br>
Grow sweeter each season<br>
As we slowly grow old
