## Lyrics
Sprung like a wild orchid<br>
Curled like a wave<br>
Hanging like wood smoke yeah<br>
In the airy glade<br>
Only the wine talking<br>
Only the wine<br>
Head spinning, mouth open<br>
Time after time<br>
Sympathetic<br>
Won't forget it<br>
Hope I never live to see the day<br>
Gone forever<br>
Ah whatever<br>
Help me find a way<br>
Home<br>
Coiled in my synapses<br>
Poised like a snake<br>
There as the time lapses<br>
And the levee breaks<br>
Only the wine talking<br>
Only the wine<br>
Head spinning, mouth open<br>
Time after time<br>
Sympathetic<br>
Won't forget it<br>
Hope I never live to see the day<br>
Gone forever<br>
Ah whatever<br>
Help me find a way<br>
The way<br>
The way<br>
