*"[Great music][^1] invigorates our best faculties and...inspires love in the highest part of the soul."* (â€”Iris Murdoch)

[^1]:In actuality she said "great art" or "good art", and so I'm taking some license with her quote.

Music is such a big topic that this needs to be a hub with subpages:
- [My Music Odyssey](/musicbio/)
- [Recordings](/recordings/)
- My desert island discs (and other sundry musical opinions) *(forthcoming)*
