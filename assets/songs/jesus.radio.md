## Lyrics
5a.m. March 16<br>
Jesus on the radio<br>
You took a photograph of me<br>
On your yellow bucket seat<br>
It's too high it's too wide<br>
You're so low you don't know<br>
To get through to go around<br>
So don't look back<br>
There ain't nothing there to see<br>
Was once like you<br>
Can't say I recognize that face<br>
In that picture that you keep<br>
It's too high it's too wide<br>
You're so low you don't know<br>
To get through to go around<br>
To get through to go around
