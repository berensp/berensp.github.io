## Lyrics
5a.m. March 16
Jesus on the radio
You took a photograph of me
On your yellow bucket seat
It's too high it's too wide
You're so low you don't know
To get through to go around
So don't look back
There ain't nothing there to see
Was once like you
Can't say I recognize that face
In that picture that you keep
It's too high it's too wide
You're so low you don't know
To get through to go around
To get through to go around
