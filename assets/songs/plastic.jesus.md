## Lyrics
I don't care if it rains or freezes<br>
as long as I've got my plastic Jesus<br>
sitting on the dashboard of my car<br>
it comes in colors pink and pleasant<br>
it glows in the dark cause it's iridescent<br>
I'll take it with me whenever I go far<br>
so give me my lady Madonna<br>
dressed in rhinestones and sitting on a<br>
pedestal of abalone shells<br>
driving 90 but I'm not scared<br>
'cause I've got my Virgin Mary<br>
assuring me that I will never go to hell<br>

All my friends are getting older,<br>
I guess I must be too.<br>
Without their love and kindness<br>
I don't want I'll do<br>
Oh the wine bottle's half empty<br>
The money's all been spent<br>
We're a cross between our parents<br>
And hippies in a tent.<br>
Oh, Love calls like the wild birds<br>
It's just another day<br>
A spring wind blew my list of things to do away.<br>
In a mucked up lovely river<br>
I cast my little fly<br>
But I look at that river and I smell it and<br>
it makes me want to cry, Oh<br>
To clean our dirty planet<br>
Now there's a noble wish<br>
And now I'm putting shoulder to the wheel<br>
Cause I wanna catch some fish, Oh<br>
Love calls just like the wild birds<br>
It's just another day<br>
A spring blew my list of things to do away.<br>
