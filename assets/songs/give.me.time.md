## Lyrics
Give me time
Give me time
If there's one thing you could give
To help me show you all that's mine
Give me time

Show me love
Show me love
If there's one thing that you know
That I've not had any of
Show me love

Help me see
Help me see
If you know what it would take
To find the patience that you need
Help me see

Give me time
Give me time
If there's one thing you could give
To help me show you all that's mine
Give me time
