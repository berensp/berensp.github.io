## Lyrics
Give me time<br>
Give me time<br>
If there's one thing you could give<br>
To help me show you all that's mine<br>
Give me time

Show me love<br>
Show me love<br>
If there's one thing that you know<br>
That I've not had any of<br>
Show me love

Help me see<br>
Help me see<br>
If you know what it would take<br>
To find the patience that you need<br>
Help me see

Give me time<br>
Give me time<br>
If there's one thing you could give<br>
To help me show you all that's mine<br>
Give me time
