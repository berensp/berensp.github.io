## Lyrics

Stay hydrated from a double shot<br>
Get my nourishment from a punch in the gut<br>
Never really felt I had the best of luck<br>
I got a big, big mouth that just a won't shut up<br>
Hop in the car, turn the radio on<br>
Out from the speakers, a familiar song<br>
Head down the road, start to hum a long<br>
I made it all the way home and left the TV on

But I'ma learn to fly an airplane<br>
And it's gonna make my mama proud<br>
I'm gonna get my dad to notice me<br>
Even if I have to fly it into the ground

I know my days are numbered but I'm bad at math<br>
I got a [life][^1] so hard that a cat couldn't scratch<br>
Made some bad decisions, I shouldn't go back<br>
I can't see her, it's just-a not like that
You see I had this lovin' baby but I [messed it][^1] up<br>
There's a little ounce of pain behind every grunt<br>
All the noise that I make, I shouldn't complain<br>
Regrets, Tourettes, I guess it's the same

But I'ma learn to fly an airplane<br>
I'm gonna make my children proud<br>
I'm gonna make them all respect me<br>
Like when I first showed up in town, oooo!

(Sing it, Leona)

Money comin in 'cause I got child support<br>
To a family who don't want me but won't leave me alone<br>
It's a terrible way to live but it ain't my choice<br>
I sign away all my earnings on a little invoice<br>
Well, I could be the hero on the evening news<br>
Smilin' in the face of danger like there's nothing to lose<br>
Taking out terrorists before it self detonates<br>
Tell the kids stay in school and always get good grades

But I'm gonna learn to fly an airplane<br>
And I'm gonna make my country proud<br>
And I'm gonna send this song to Nashville<br>
And sell my soul to a whole new crowd
