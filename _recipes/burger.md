@Dad always used the Worcestershire sauce, so I don't skip it. 1 lb. recipe for four patties.

## Ingredients
- 1 lb. 80% lean 20% fat ground beef or ground chuck
- 1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tsp seasoning salt
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- cheese slices
- hamburger buns
- other toppings: lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, ketchup, mustard, mayo, etc.

## Instructions
1. Preheat the grill to 375 degrees F (medium-high).
2. Sprinkle ingredients evenly across beef. Mix until they are just combined.
3. Divide mixture into fourths → make patties →
4. Make indentation in the middle to prevent the bulging!
5. Cook 4-5 minutes per side. (You get one flip and one flip only.)
