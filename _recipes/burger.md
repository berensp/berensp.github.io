## Ingredients
- 1 lb. 80% lean 20% fat ground beef or ground chuck
- 1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce [^1]
- 1 tsp. seasoning salt
- 1 tsp. garlic powder
- ½ tsp. ground black pepper
- cheese slices
- hamburger buns
- other toppings: lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, ketchup, mustard, mayo, etc.

[^1]: @Dad always used the Worcestershire sauce, so I don't skip it. 1 lb. recipe for four patties.

## Instructions
1. Preheat the grill to 375°F (medium-high)... or your cast iron skillet to sizzling hot.
2. Sprinkle ingredients evenly across beef. Mix until they are just combined [^2]
3. Divide mixture into fourths → make patties →
4. Make indentation in the middle to prevent the bulging!
5. Cook 4-5 minutes per side. (You get one flip and one flip only.)
6. Enjoy der 🍔

[^2]: Be sure you don't overdo it with the mixing or your burgers may end up on the "tough" side.
