## Ingredients
- 1 cup broccoli florets (roughly chopped)
- 1 cup fully cooked short grain brown rice
- ½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1 tbsp. grated Parmesan
- 2 eggs
- ¼ cup Italian-flavored or regular breadcrumbs
- ¼ tsp. salt (optional)
- ¼ tsp. Italian seasoning or cumin (optional)

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 375°F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Bring a kettle of water to a boil and pour over the broccoli in a heat-safe bowl. Let sit for about 5 minutes. Drain well.
3. Add the broccoli, rice, cheese, Parmesan, eggs, and breadcrumbs to the bowl of a food processor. Add salt and either Italian seasoning or cumin to add a little additional flavor if desired.
4. Grind very well to make a uniform batter. (If your batter doesn’t seem to be holding together well, add another tablespoon or two of breadcrumbs.)
5. Portion into 1-tablespoon size ovals and place on the prepared baking sheet.
6. Bake for 25-27 minutes or until firm to the touch and lightly golden brown. (Or cook in an Air Fryer at 375 degrees F for 10-12 minutes on a greased tray.) Let cool slightly and serve.
