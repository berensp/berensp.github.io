## Meatloaf ingredients
- 1 lb. ground beef (or ground turkey s'il vous plaît)
- ½ cup crushed buttery round crackers
- ⅓ cup milk
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 1 carrot, grated
- 1 egg
- 1 (heaping) tsp. minced garlic
- 1 tsp. salt
- ¼ tsp. ground black pepper

## Topping
- ⅓ cup ketchup
- 2 tbsp brown sugar
- 1 tbsp. worcestershire sauce

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
2. Mix ground beef, crushed crackers, milk, onion, carrot, egg, garlic, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Shape mixture into a loaf and place on the prepared baking sheet with wax paper.
3. Mix ketchup, brown sugar, and Worcestershire sauce in a separate bowl; set aside.
4. Bake meatloaf in preheated oven for 30 minutes; remove from the oven and drain off liquids. Top meatloaf with ketchup topping.
5. Return loaf to the oven and continue baking until no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes more; an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160°F (71°C). 

Buen provecho.
