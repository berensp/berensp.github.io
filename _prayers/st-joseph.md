To you, O blessed Joseph,  
do we come in our tribulation,  
and having implored the help of your most holy Spouse,  
we confidently invoke your patronage also.  

Through that charity which bound you  
to the Immaculate Virgin Mother of God  
and through the paternal love  
with which you embraced the Child Jesus,  
we humbly beg you graciously to regard the inheritance  
which Jesus Christ has purchased by his Blood,  
and with your power and strength to aid us in our necessities.  

O most watchful guardian of the Holy Family,  
defend the chosen children of Jesus Christ;  
O most loving father, ward off from us  
every contagion of error and corrupting influence;  
O our most mighty protector, be kind to us  
and from heaven assist us in our struggle  
with the power of darkness.  

As once you rescued the Child Jesus from deadly peril,  
so now protect God's Holy Church  
from the snares of the enemy and from all adversity;  
shield, too, each one of us by your constant protection,  
so that, supported by your example and your aid,  
we may be able to live piously, to die in holiness,  
and to obtain eternal happiness in heaven.  

Amen.
