O my God,  
I am heartily sorry  
for having offended Thee,  
and I detest all my sins  
because of thy just punishments,  
but most of all  
because they offend Thee, my God,  
who art all good  
and deserving of all my love.  
I firmly resolve  
with the help of Thy grace  
to sin no more  
and to avoid the near occasion of sin.
Amen.
