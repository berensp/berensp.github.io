Credo in Deum Patrem omnipotentem,  
Creatorem caeli et terrae.  
Et in Jesum Christum,  
Filium ejus unicum,  
Dominum nostrum,  
qui conceptus est de Spiritu Sancto,  
natus ex Maria Virgine,  
passus sub Pontio Pilato,  
crucifixus, mortuus, et sepultus,  
descendit ad inferos,  
tertia die resurrexit a mortuis,  
ascendit ad caelos,  
sedet ad dexteram Dei Patris omnipotentis,  
inde venturus est judicare vivos et mortuos.  
Credo in Spiritum Sanctum,  
sanctam Ecclesiam catholicam,  
sanctorum communionem,  
remissionem peccatorum,  
carnis resurrectionem,  
vitam aeternam.  
Amen.

I believe in God,  
the Father almighty,  
Creator of heaven and earth,  
and in Jesus Christ,  
his only Son, our Lord,  
who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,  
born of the Virgin Mary,  
suffered under Pontius Pilate,  
was crucified, died and was buried;  
he descended into hell;  
on the third day  
he rose again from the dead;  
he ascended into heaven,  
and is seated at the right hand  
of God the Father almighty;  
from there he will come to judge  
the living and the dead.  
I believe in the Holy Spirit,  
the holy catholic Church,  
the communion of saints,  
the forgiveness of sins,  
the resurrection of the body,  
and life everlasting.  
Amen.
