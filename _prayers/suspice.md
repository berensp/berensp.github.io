Receive, O Lord, all my liberty.  
Take my memory,  
my understanding, and  
my entire will.

Whatsoever I have or possess  
you have given to me;  
I give it all back to you  
and surrender it wholly to  
be governed by your will.

Give me love for you alone,  
along with your grace,  
I am rich enough and ask for  
nothing more.
