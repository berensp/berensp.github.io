Almighty eternal God,  
behold, I come to the Sacrament  
of your Only Begotten Son,  
our Lord Jesus Christ,  
as one sick to the physician of life,  
as one unclean to the fountain of mercy,  
as one blind to the light of eternal brightness,  
as one poor and needy to the Lord of heaven and earth.

I ask, therefore, for the abundance of your immense generosity,  
that you may graciously cure my sickness,  
wash away my defilement,  
give light to my blindness,  
enrich my poverty,  
clothe my nakedness,  
so that I may receive the bread of Angels,  
the King of kings and Lord of lords,  
with such reverence and humility,  
such contrition and devotion,  
such purity and faith,  
such purpose and intention  
as are conducive to the salvation of my soul.  

Grant, I pray, that I may receive  
not only the Sacrament of the Lordâ€™s Body and Blood,  
but also the reality and power of that Sacrament.  
O most gentle God,  
grant that I may so receive  
the Body of your Only Begotten Son our Lord Jesus Christ,  
which he took from the Virgin Mary,  
that I may be made worthy  
to be incorporated into his Mystical Body  
and to be counted among its members.

O most loving Father,  
grant that I may at last gaze for ever  
upon the unveiled face of your beloved Son,  
whom I, a wayfarer,  
propose to receive now veiled under these species:  
Who lives and reigns with you for ever and ever.  
Amen.
