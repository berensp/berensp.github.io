Saint Michael the Archangel,  
defend us in battle.  
Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil.  
May God rebuke him, we humbly pray.  
And do thou, O Prince of the Heavenly Host,  
by the power of God, cast into hell Satan and all evil spirits who prowl throughout the world seeking the ruin of souls.
