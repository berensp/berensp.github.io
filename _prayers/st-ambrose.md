I draw near, loving Lord Jesus Christ,  
to the table of your most delightful banquet  
in fear and trembling,  
a sinner, presuming not upon my own merits,  
but trusting rather in your goodness and mercy.  

I have a heart and body defiled by my many offenses,  
a mind and tongue  
over which I have kept no good watch.

Therefore, O loving God, O awesome Majesty,  
I turn in my misery, caught in snares,  
to you the fountain of mercy,  
hastening to you for healing,  
flying to you for protection;  
and while I do not look forward to having you as Judge,  
I long to have you as Savior.

To you, O Lord, I display my wounds,  
to you I uncover my shame.  
I am aware of my many and great sins,  
for which I fear,  
but I hope in your mercies,  
which are without number.

Look upon me, then, with eyes of mercy,  
Lord Jesus Christ, eternal King,  
God and Man, crucified for mankind.

Listen to me, as I place my hope in you,  
have pity on me, full of miseries and sins,  
you, who will never cease  
to let the fountain of compassion flow.

Hail, O Saving Victim,  
offered for me and for the whole human race  
on the wood of the Cross.

Hail, O noble and precious Blood,  
flowing from the wounds  
of Jesus Christ, my crucified Lord,  
and washing away the sins of all the world.

Remember, Lord, your creature,  
whom you redeemed by your Blood.  
I am repentant of my sins,  
I desire to put right what I have done.

Take from me, therefore, most merciful Father,  
all my iniquities and sins,  
so that, purified in mind and body,  
I may worthily taste the Holy of Holies.

And grant that this sacred foretaste  
of your Body and Blood  
which I, though unworthy, intend to receive,  
may be the remission of my sins,  
the perfect cleansing of my faults,  
the banishment of shameful thoughts,  
and the rebirth of right sentiments;  
and may it encourage  
a wholesome and effective performance  
of deeds pleasing to you  
and be a most firm defense of body and soul  
against the snares of my enemies.  
Amen.
