I draw near, loving Lord Jesus Christ,  
to the table of your most delightful banquet  
in fear and trembling,  
a sinner, presuming not upon my own merits,  
but trusting rather in your goodness and mercy.  

I have a heart and body defiled by my many offenses,  
a mind and tongue  
over which I have kept no good watch.

Therefore, O loving God, O awesome Majesty,  
I turn in my misery, caught in snares,  
to you the fountain of mercy,  
hastening to you for healing,  
flying to you for protection;  
and while I do not look forward to having you as Judge,  
I long to have you as Savior.

To you, O Lord, I display my wounds,  
to you I uncover my shame.  
I am aware of my many and great sins,  
for which I fear,  
but I hope in your mercies,  
which are without number.

Look upon me, then, with eyes of mercy,  
Lord Jesus Christ, eternal King,  
God and Man, crucified for mankind.

Listen to me, as I place my hope in you,  
have pity on me, full of miseries and sins,  
you, who will never cease  
to let the fountain of compassion flow.

Hail, O Saving Victim,  
offered for me and for the whole human race  
on the wood of the Cross.

Hail, O noble and precious Blood,  
flowing from the wounds  
of Jesus Christ, my crucified Lord,  
and washing away the sins of all the world.

Remember, Lord, your creature,  
whom you redeemed by your Blood.  
I am repentant of my sins,  
I desire to put right what I have done.

Take from me, therefore, most merciful Father,  
all my iniquities and sins,  
so that, purified in mind and body,  
I may worthily taste the Holy of Holies.

And grant that this sacred foretaste  
of your Body and Blood  
which I, though unworthy, intend to receive,  
may be the remission of my sins,  
the perfect cleansing of my faults,  
the banishment of shameful thoughts,  
and the rebirth of right sentiments;  
and may it encourage  
a wholesome and effective performance  
of deeds pleasing to you  
and be a most firm defense of body and soul  
against the snares of my enemies.  
Amen.

## Prayer of Saint Thomas Aquinas

Almighty eternal God,  
behold, I come to the Sacrament  
of your Only Begotten Son,  
our Lord Jesus Christ,  
as one sick to the physician of life,  
as one unclean to the fountain of mercy,  
as one blind to the light of eternal brightness,  
as one poor and needy to the Lord of heaven and earth.

I ask, therefore, for the abundance of your immense generosity,  
that you may graciously cure my sickness,  
wash away my defilement,  
give light to my blindness,  
enrich my poverty,  
clothe my nakedness,  
so that I may receive the bread of Angels,  
the King of kings and Lord of lords,  
with such reverence and humility,  
such contrition and devotion,  
such purity and faith,  
such purpose and intention  
as are conducive to the salvation of my soul.  

Grant, I pray, that I may receive  
not only the Sacrament of the Lordâ€™s Body and Blood,  
but also the reality and power of that Sacrament.  
O most gentle God,  
grant that I may so receive  
the Body of your Only Begotten Son our Lord Jesus Christ,  
which he took from the Virgin Mary,  
that I may be made worthy  
to be incorporated into his Mystical Body  
and to be counted among its members.

O most loving Father,  
grant that I may at last gaze for ever  
upon the unveiled face of your beloved Son,  
whom I, a wayfarer,  
propose to receive now veiled under these species:  
Who lives and reigns with you for ever and ever.  
Amen.
