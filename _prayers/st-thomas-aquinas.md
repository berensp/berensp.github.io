Grant me, O Lord my God,  
a mind to know you,  
a heart to seek you,  
wisdom to find you,  
conduct pleasing to you,  
faithful perseverance in waiting for you,  
and a hope of finally embracing you.  

Amen.

Grant, o merciful God,  
that I may ardently desire,  
prudently examine,  
truthfully acknowledge,  
and perfectly accomplish  
what is pleasing to Thee  
for the praise and glory of Thy name.  
Amen.
