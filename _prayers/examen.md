*"Speak little, listen much."* (—St. Ignatius of Loyolase)

1. [Signum Crucis](/prayers/signum-crucis/)
2. **Become aware of God's presence.** Look back on the events of the day in the company of the Holy Spirit. The day may have been a blur. Ask God to bring clarity and understanding.
3. **Review the day with gratitude.** Walk through your day in the presence of God and note its joys and delights, the day's gifts, the work you did, the people you interacted with. All the details.
4. **Pay attention to your emotions.** One of St. Ignatius's great insights was that we detect the presence of the Spirit of God in the movements of our emotions. Reflect on the feelings you experienced during the day. Boredom? Elation? Resentment? Compassion? Anger? Confidence? What is God saying through these feelings? God will most likely show you some ways that you fell short. Make note of these sins and faults. Look deeply for other implications (e.g., does a feeling of frustration perhaps mean that God wants you consider a new direction in some area of your work? Are you concerned about a friend and should reach out?).
5. **Choose one feature of the day and pray from it.** Ask the Holy Spirit to direct you to something during the day that might be particularly important. It may involve a feeling—positive or negative. It may be a significant encounter with another person or a vivid moment of pleasure or peace. It may be something that seems rather insignificant. Look at it. Pray about it. Allow the prayer to arise spontaneously from your heart—whether intercession, praise, repentance, or gratitude.
6. **Look toward tomorrow.** Ask God to give you light for tomorrow's challenges. Pay attention to the feelings that surface as you survey what's coming up. Are you doubtful? Cheerful? Apprehensive? Full of delighted anticipation? Allow these feelings to turn into prayer. Seek His guidance. Ask Him for help and understanding and hope.
