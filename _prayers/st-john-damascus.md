<notabene>Say the following while pointing at your bed:</notabene>

O Master, Who lovest mankind, is this bed to be my coffin? Or wilt Thou grant my wretched soul to see the light of another day? Behold, before me lies the tomb, before me standeth death. I fear Thy judgment and eternal torment, and yet, O Lord, I do not cease from doing evil. I always anger Thee, O Lord My God, and Thy most pure Mother, and all the heavenly powers and my holy Guardian Angel. I know, O Lord, that I am unworthy of Thy love for mankind. Rather, I am worthy of every condemnation and torment. Yet save me, O Lord, whether I will it or not! For to save the righteous is no great thing and to have mercy on the pure is nothing wonderful. For they are worthy of mercy. But make marvelous Thy mercy toward me a sinner and so reveal Thy love for mankind lest my wickedness overcome thine inexpressible goodness and mercy. Order my life as Thou wilt.

<notabene>Before lying down in bed:</notabene>

Enlighten my eyes, O Christ God, lest I sleep unto death, lest my enemy say, "I have prevailed over him."

*Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit,* Be my soul's advocate, O good God, for I walk in the midst of many snares. Deliver me from them and save me in Thy love for mankind, now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.

With all our heart and never-silent mouths, let us praise the most glorious Mother of God, more holy than the holy angels, let us confess her as Theotokos, for in very truth she gave birth to God-made-flesh and without ceasing she prays for our souls.

<notabene>Kiss the Cross and make the sign of the Cross over the bed, head-to-foot and then side-to-side, saying this prayer to the Precious Cross:</notabene>

Let God arise; Let His enemies be scattered. Let those who hate Him flee before His face. As smoke vanishes, so let them vanish. As wax melts before the fire, so let demons flee at the presence of those who love God and sign themselves with the sign of the Cross and say joyfully, "Rejoice most precious and life-giving Cross of the Lord which drivest demons away through the power of Our Lord Jesus Christ who was crucified on thee, who descended into hell, trampled down the power of the devil and gave to us His precious Cross for the routing of all enemies. Help me forever, most precious and life-giving Cross of the Lord, together with the Holy Lady Virgin Theotokos and all the saints. Amen.  

O God, absolve, remit and pardon our transgressionsâ€”voluntary and involuntary, committed in word or deed, thought or intention, whether in knowledge or in ignorance, whether by day or by night.  Forgive us everything, for Thou art good and lovest mankind.

Into thy hands, O Lord Jesus Christ, my God, do I commend my spirit. Do thou bless me, have mercy on me, and grant me life everlasting. Amen.

<notabene> Make the sign of the Cross and fall asleep with prayer, contemplating the Day of Judgment and the summons before God.</notabene>
