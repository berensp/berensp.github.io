title: Seven Sorrows Rosary
category: Marian
---
This devotion to Our Sorrowful Mother originated in the thirteenth century. It recalls the Sorrows the Virgin Mother of God endured in
compassion for the suffering and death of her Divine Son. The Litany of the Seven Sorrows of Our Lady was composed by Pope Pius VII (1740-1823) while held in captivity during the Napoleonic Wars. St. Bridget of Sweden (1303-1373 reported that Our Lady promised to grant seven graces to those who honor her and draw near to her and her Son every day by meditating on her dolors (sorrows)[^1].

[^1]: (1) I will grant peace to their families. (2) They will be enlightened about the divine Mysteries. (3) I will console them in their pains and will accompany them in their work. (4) I will give them as much as they ask for as long as it does not oppose the adorable will of my divine Son or the sanctification of their souls. (5) I will defend them in their spiritual battles with the infernal enemy and I will protect them at every instant of their lives. (6) I will visibly help them at the moment of their death—they will see the face of their mother. (7) I have obtained this grace from my divine Son: that those who propagate this devotion to my tears and sorrows will be taken directly from this earthly life to eternal happiness, since all their sins will be forgiven and my Son will be their eternal consolation and joy.

## The Third Sword of Sorrow: Mary seeks Jesus lost in Jerusalem (Luke 2:41-51)

O Mother of Sorrows, what grief filled your heart as you and Joseph searched desperately for Jesus when you could not find Him among your relatives and friends returning home from Jerusalem. When your Son replied that He must be about His Father’s business, you accepted that He had begun the mission that would lead to His sacrificial death. The sorrow of those three days of separation prepared you for the three days of suffering you endured while His body lay lifeless in the tomb. Through this bitter sword of sorrow obtain for us the grace to accept the ways of Divine Providence even when we do not understand them.

O Mother of Sorrows, how it must have wounded your tender maternal heart to see your beloved Son Jesus carrying His Cross to Calvary, the place of execution!

## The Seventh Sword of Sorrow: Mary helps place the body of Jesus in the tomb (cf. John 19:39-42)

O Mother of Sorrows, who could express the cruel anguish of this moment? The same Child that you once wrapped in swaddling clothes amidst unspeakable joy, you now wrap silently in His burial shroud.

Your mourning was not without hope, for you knew that He would rise again from this grave just as He promised. Through this bitter sword of sorrow obtain for us the grace to believe with unshakable hope in the victory of our Lord even in the darkest moments of life.
