title: Prayer of St. Bernardine of Siena
---
Jesus, a name full of glory, grace, love and strength!  
You are the refuge of those who repent,  
our banner of warfare in this life,  
the medicine of souls,  
the comfort of those who mourn,  
the delight of those who believe,  
the light of those who preach the true faith,  
the wages of those who toil,  
the healing of the sick.

To You our devotion aspires;  
by You our prayers are received;  
we delight in contemplating You.  
O Name of Jesus,  
You are the glory of all the saints for eternity.

Amen.
