## Where did this lovely template come from?
It was originally called Clio and was developed by [Dan Romero](https://danromero.org), though I've messed with it a fair amount. It's designed to be hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). You can read more about the [GitHub Pages + Jekyll integration](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll).
